america as a democracy is slowly crumbling before our eyes but the world will go on

the good

 we democratically elected a president there was no violence although if the dems had won trump was certainly going to incite more violence historically speaking people get the elected leaders they deserve

the bad

 competent government there is no question that kamala would have presided over a competent federal government she had sound policies which btw were incredibly centrist that are supported by a majority of americans trump will install political hacks and sycophants in all levels of government how do i know check schedule f we are in for bureaucratic nightmares
 economy the us economy by all measures is the best of the developed world since covid by a long shot stock market indices are good inflation has cooled unemployment is at its lowest sustained levels in years manufacturing jobs roared back under biden so essentially biden took a shitty economy which btw was not all of trumps fault but he does share quite a bit of blame his taxation policies have continued the hollowing out of the middle class by transferring the tax burden from the super rich down to lower economic brackets and landed it perfectly with help from the federal reserve trumps policies will have some pretty negative longterm consequences for the us when they say tax cuts everyone making under  will see their taxes increase only those making over  will see a decrease in their taxes
 environment regulations designed to protect human health and welfare will be eroded when you get pancreatic cancer from pfoapfas i hope you buy a maga branded colostomy bag from team trump
 education they are going to continue to devalue education expect the quality of education in this country to decline
 health care we already have a health care system that is in shambles no western country pays more for health care and has worse outcomes if you really want to understand why i would highly suggest reading americas bitter pill by stephen brill

the ugly

 hate america embraced hate like it has never embraced hate before first election of trump yeah ill give you a pass for electing him but second go round you know exactly who you voted for and why dont kid yourself there have been white nationalist movements in this country going all the way back to the knownothings but maga is that on on jp it is cruelty to those that are the most vulnerable amongst us people of color immigrants the marginalized those people will lose the most a president that called large swaths of american citizens the enemy and turned americans against each other is now going to be there for the next four years
 constitutional government americans elected a president that has continually shown is willing to break the law and ignore the constitution the guardrails are off the adults that were in the room that recognized the importance of the constitution are gone all bets are off we have full monty trump and it is going to be dayafterday constitutional asswiping for the next four years he is who is is and he will do what he says is going to do he has also packed the court with ideologues that have skewed versions of the constitution and the limits of executive authority
 russia the biggest winner in all of this while maga was popping corks and dems were in tears nobody noticed that russia actively attacked our election they attacked in the leadup and they attacked it on election day this happened and really it should be the lead story it is also hugely problematic that twitter x is also being used as a propaganda tool for the russian government when musk had shortfalls to purchase he relied on outside investors including some middle eastern and russian to front the money with musks contacts with putin this is incredibly problematic i find it interesting that the maga crowd who is virulently anticommunist is okay with musks cozying up to communist and a presidential candidate that has had multiple offtherecord conversations with putin i am not saying that musk or trump committed treason but they are sailing perilously close to the fucking wind here

there is much more but this is the sad truth the national media is also to blame here but probably not for the reasons you think especially maga we live in a nation that has fully embraced fear and ignorance we will reap what we sow americans are asking the wrong questions do we want to live in a country in which the richest control access to the truth do we want an economy that destroys the middle class do we want to continue to degrade the environment",Democrat

for those who think trump is just being stupid you werent paying attention when he said he liked the tariffs of the s 

that was the time when most of the federal governments revenue came from tariffs because there were no personal income taxes

and of course if there are tariffs on other countries there will be a trade war which will decrease us exports and likely cause a recession 

meanwhile i wouldnt count on trump eliminating all personal income taxes for everyone republicans could just get rid of the top earned income tax bracket 

and then reduce capital gains tax rates as capital gains on asset sales and qualified dividends constitute the bulk of the very wealthys income most of them dont make much at all in earned income

less dramatic but equally intense has been the change in security before  you could go to an airport and walk your friends almost to the plane you could hang out in an airport and watch planes take off just for fun you didnt have to be there  hours early to go through security you could bring anything legal on the plane with youthings like knitting needles and penknives and scissors on domestic flights no one looked at your luggage no one would dream of making you go through a metal detector and take your shoes off you could go into almost any government or commercial building without metal detectors you might have to show some id but that was it i remember being told how terrible it was in russia that people needed identification papers to travel between cities i didnt carry id till i was in my late s i traveled to the caribbean and to canada with only a voter registration card to prove my citizenship

thats probably why he has a  approval rating coming into office 

you are so afraid of some project  and so engrossed in your hatred of a person youve never met that you refuse to see whats happening in the present moment how anyone can be more afraid of something that he has categorically denied time after time having anything to do with his agenda over what is actually happening in front of them and around the world at present time is just astounding to me 


contrast to the current president on his path to destroying not just  the entire globe but most importantly  the united states and every single citizen in it leaving with the most godawful approval rating of any sitting president  at  

why arent you people spending time focusing on the current crisis that is in office  instead of all of these absurdities about the next president

how it seems not a single one of you are concerned at all that the current administration is doing everything they can to intensify conflict with russia funneling as much money as possible as he can out of the united states taxpayers pocket and into an absolutely unwinnable war in the most simplistic terms is beyond me 

all the while doing everything they can to bring in as many people as possible to a nation they are just going to get thrown back out of instead of exercising some actual humanity and empathy and doing the right thing for those people since they clearly dont give a shit about the people of this country by denying them entry into our country

now keep in mind the entire time theyve been letting people just walk into our country and giving them money and housing and food we have homeless and hungry americans and people that have tried to obtain citizenship legally for years  who have assimilated integrated  paid taxes  yet have still been deported 

where is the fucking justice in that 

you all ought to be far more concerned with what the absolute joke of a sitting president and his cabinet are doing  and leaving for all of us  no matter who you voted for  they dont care if you voted for them  they are hell bent on destroying this nation and the quality of life for everyone in it  

trump at least loves this country and cares about the principles that this country was founded upon and thats really honestly all that matters to the people that voted for him because we can all see how much the sitting president and that god awful candidate if you can call her that they tried to get elected who actually despise and hate everything this country stands for in all of the people in it including the absolutely idiotic people that voted for them",Neutral

the working class are their slaves according to their perspective and they see anything we have above bare subsistence is stealing wealth directly from them

 moving the goalposts is an informal logical fallacy in which previously agreedupon standards for deciding an argument are arbitrarily changed once they have been met usually the losing side in an argument deploys this gambit in a desperate bid to save face

liberal,"exactly  roger stones motto was hate is a better motivator than love and he has been a strategist since the early s  he was involved with ncpac whom was the group that changed the game  then an entire media ecosystem also developed that was all about hate

democrats keep trying to appeal through rational arguments but on a mass scale this just is not as effective  populists are very emotionally driven  the trust in the system is just not there either and democrats behave as if people have trust in the institutions",Neutral
liberal,"anger in general is better motivator

no no we need to campaign on joy and loving the status quo",Neutral
liberal,he is also the racist,Neutral
liberal,"i think its accepted that it would have been a gamble

but when the other option is bomb them and get it over with how is maybe ceasefire maybe not a worse option

at least we can see it coming",Neutral
liberal,"did they want to save lives

they voted for the bomb palistine and do it fast candidate that doesnt seem to be on the side of wanting to save peoples lives in fact it seems like they chose to advocate for a garenteed genocide over pushing for the candidate who was on the fence and softly pushing for a ceasefirewhich isnt positive except when put against bomb them all no restrictions

sure propalistine trump voters talked a big game but their words are naught but ashes on their tongues when they betrayed their cause with their actions",Neutral
liberal,then voting for trump was the height of stupidity,Neutral
liberal,as an american jew i have tolerated their hate my whole fucking life so pardon me if i dont give a flying fuck that they regret anything,Neutral
liberal,they voted for orange hitler so again fuck what they think,Neutral
liberal,yeah that part sucks,Neutral

liberal,"the optimistic view is that democrats just dont want to allow our national politics to fall all the way down into the abyss that maybe we can claw our way back to some degree of civility even if its just s level lewinsky civility

probably impossible but i do think theres some of that sentiment still affecting how the dems are acting today",Neutral
liberal,"biden was pushing for a ceasefire always the only ones who didnt back it were the plo now they will have to deal with the guy who said benji hasnt gone far enough and has a neighborhood in the occupied territory named after him 

good news for dems is palestine wont be an issue in",Neutral
liberal,the dumbest trump voters understand that if you vote for a candidate that will support  of what you want that will move the needle forward too bad the leftist havent learned that simple lesson,Neutral

liberal,ya i totally buy that youve experienced sooooo much hate from arabs as an american jew,Neutral
liberal,the vast majority of them did not vote for trump they simply did not vote out of protest,Neutral
liberal,legally a genocide refers to acts committed with the intent to destroy either in part or in whole another ethnic group you dont have to kill  million people for it to be a genocide this would almost undoubtedly be considered a genocide by every major world power if it was any one else besides the jews doing the killing,Neutral
liberal,"your friend sounds like another voter who chopped off his nose to spite his face and thats a shame 

trump is going to give preferential treatment to white christian americans  your indonesian muslim friend his family and his community will not be invited to sit at that table 

they will not be considered in policymaking there will be no allocation of resources to facilitate healthy respect for his muslim traditions under trump",Neutral

liberal,"same thing

if you dont vote you support the winner 

 harris  trump  not voting really means  voted for trump",Neutral
liberal,hes not selfhating many muslims share the same values as christians so theyll tend to vote in a similar fashion trump never did anything in his first term to sabotage my friends family then if anything he helped them buy land and build a new home a lot of people just dont see race like a competition anymore whats good for whites and good for blacks is usually the same things low food costs low interest curbed inflation etc basic stuff everyone needs to survive,Neutral
liberal,from what i see though the vote count is far from done the turnout was way below the last election cycle im amazed by that quite frankly so far its looking like she got  million less than biden did in  while trump got  million less votes than he got in,Neutral
liberal,people are ignoring the obvious answer this is who we as a nation are,Neutral
liberal,stunned is the operative word here  ill say this much  trump has probably been elected for a second time  perhaps even with the popular vote  the senate has been flipped to republicans and the house may soon be retained by republicans  giving republicans total control of the executive legislative  and judicial branches of the united states of america  should that be the case america is actively choosing trumps view of this country and denying the liberal view of this country  it is our shared liberal reality that is out of step with the country  perhaps not by much  but certainly by enough  and we need to first admit this and second begin the process of understanding it,Neutral
liberal,because  million people who voted in  decided not to vote  trump has  million less votes than  and harris has  million less  appalling turnout,Neutral
liberal,he has said repeatedly something along the line that he had something up his sleeve him and mike johnson had a special secret,Neutral
liberal,million votes that showed up for biden didnt for harris,Neutral

liberal,voter suppression,Neutral
liberal,i try to avoid speculation but he made far too many comments in recent months about there being nothing to worry about they have a plan and that he and mike johnson have a little secret to convince me that this electionand his winwas above board,Neutral
liberal,"short answer that i dont see enough people talking about is that everyone hated kamala in  she was the laughing stock of the democratic party getting torn apart by tulsi gabbard of all people

 times in  years the democrats have run a subpar uncharismatic polarizing candidate who is unappealing to the votes that matter independentmiddle rightleft leaning voters",Neutral
liberal,he won a similar amount from  harris is  million off biden thats the reason millions of voters didnt show up,Neutral
liberal,because more people voted for him in both the popular and electoral votes it sucks but thats pretty straightforward really,Neutral
liberal,im dumbfounded trump is possibility the worst person as president,Neutral
liberal,"so the right has a a decadeslong plan in place it started with gerrymandering texas and then a resolute plan to take over state legislatures and do the same in as many states as possible

from there the plan was to take control of the house and senate eventually the white house and finally the supreme court they engaged with fundamentalist christians as a means of accumulating voters and reaching them in ways media cannot

and theyve been successful at every turn not every election but they have consciously addressed missteps and come back stronger

democrats are still practicing politics like its the s find a candidate run a campaign and hope to win they have no cohesive long term agenda like the right does until they consciously address this with a full plan we can expect more nights like last night",Neutral
liberal,deleted,Neutral
liberal,"we have to get back to meeting the electorate where they are on stuff rather than lecturing them about how theyre wrong and we have to start speaking to rural voters we cant keep only putting up  out there

i keep coming back to fundamentally a political campaign isnt the time to persuade the electorate of shit on which they disagree with us especially if its multiple issues 

we have to be persuading all the time but when its campaign time we have to meet the voters where they are 

we told them they were wrong on the border wrong on immigration wrong on inflation wrong on crime wrong on trans issues etc 

well actually isnt a great way to start a conversation with an electorate

we only shifted on gay marriage after a decade of ellen and will and grace do you actually think obama opposed gay marriage in his heart in  no he was strategic he recognized that the best way to be an ally isnt always to center a campaign on a fight over an unpopular minority or minority position

its time for moderate probusiness southern dems to lead the party back out of the wilderness as we had to after reagan",Neutral

his campaign was brilliant",Neutral
liberal,because kamala and the dems thought it was a good idea to campaign with liz fucking cheney how stupid can we be to think embracing the family that is directly responsible for thousands of american families losing their child was a good idea,Neutral
liberal,"because people vote with their wallets you guys cmon 

if you only get your news here and only look at liberal websites that want kamala to win youre in an echo chamber this whole sub was so delusional it was so obvious for months

liberal,many people werent interested in the green new deal bidens rants on the oil companies and being pushed to have an electric car  they werent interested in an open southern border  they werent interested in gender politics and birthing people  and they werent interested in a black woman who was the candidate through party machinations rather than through voter primary process  harris simply stood for being the democrat platform and that isnt good enough  i would have thought the democrats would have learned when they pushed hillary clinton to the front as the candidate because it was her time  they did the same thing with harris and got the same result  a moderate candidate would have easily beat the insane felon that was elected  people dont want too much change so rather than voting for the left extreme you get the right extreme,Neutral

sorry silver lining is in short supply",Neutral
liberal,we get the america we deserve kamala was a great candidate however the original sin was joe biden deciding to run again and prohibiting an organic candidacy to occur for democrats since they have zero ground game in rural america they need to win big in the margins around urban centers as we can all see  there were enough people put off by having their candidate chosen for them while the margin of people who believe the maga bullshit grew looking at young men latinos double digit gains from last cycle young black men  all groups that a populism appeal helped get them to the polls democrats increased women dobbs decision but made little inroads elsewhere democracy doesnt motivate people like it used to and here we are but not being able to choose a candidate through the organic process of running for president should be one lesson here we lose big on immigration also,Democrat
liberal,"this is what happens when democrats pretend that issues are not issues and that certain aspects of our nation were irrefutably better under trump 

he won the popular vote he is representing the majority perspective of what is needed suffering has been allowed to occur without the labeling of it as being suffering for too long and people are fed up with being lied to",Neutral

liberal,stop demonizing masculinity and white males,Neutral

liberal,thank you for being honest if the democratic candidate was more middle grounded then i think there would have been a real shot there are tons of people who voted trump not because they love him but because kamala has just as radical views but in the opposite way i think if the candidate was less pushy about abortion trans guns and immigration youd have a winner if abortion was pushed for when medically necessary but not as a form of birth control that would be a good angle allow adults to do what they want by becoming trans but dont allow anyone under  or  im a gun nut so id say all i all guns but i do realize that a good middle ground would be to make the fbi double and triple check the background checks that we already have and that immigration should be allowed through the proper process,Neutral

trump voters though its like they have no doubt in their minds and theyre crazier than a ferret sausage and about as reasonable as a hungry shark 

if you point out any of many many criminal immoral or generally bad things he is or has done or said they act like everything youre saying is fake totally deaf to anything you have to say whats worse they dont even realize theyre basically in a cult like its that bad 

youve got his supporters on here talking trash about people that bothered to get an education as in the fault that they have with the dems is that they arent poor and uneducated when did that become a sin 

not only that but what the hell do they think trump is as if he knows anything anything at all about a hard days work he hasnt had one in his entire life yet his supporters rail on the opposition as if trump even remotely cared about any of them 

it flummoxes me that they voted this guy into office again how why

donald trumps presidential campaign worked with x to prevent information about his running mate jd vance from being posted on the social media platform a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site according to reports

the former presidents team contacted x owned by the billionaire trump backer elon musk about a page document compiled by his campaign to vet vance that was linked to by ken klippenstein an independent journalist the new york times has reported

x responded by blocking links to the material claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the ohio us senators social security number and banned klippenstein from the platform

the materials published by klippenstein on his substack in september appear to be related to a hack of the trump campaign earlier this year which the fbi has linked to iran documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets which have chosen to not publish them

media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from hillary clintons  presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to trump at one point trump also said he hoped russia would be able to find some of clintons files

the leaked dossier on jd vance is revealing in all the things it doesnt say

the removal of the material from x has highlighted the increasingly strident support of musk the worlds richest person for trumps attempt to return to the white house after losing the  election to joe biden after buying twitter in  musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information even if it offended either political party

last week musk appeared at a pennsylvania rally alongside the former president performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that im not just maga  im dark maga while invoking the republican nominees make america great again slogan

musk added that this will be the last election if trump doesnt win in november against kamala harris complaining that she and her fellow democrats want to take away your freedom of speech they want to take away your right to bear arms they want to take away your right to vote effectively

klippenstein whose x account has been restored following the new york times reporting said in a substack post on friday that musk had purchased political influence and is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways

the real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the american electorate he wrote

two of our most sacred rights as americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly online or otherwise it is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account

musk is set to appear at further trump rallies  and he may even knock on voters doors for the campaign in pennsylvania in the coming week he has funded a political action entity called america pac that has spent around m to help trump reach voters in crucial swing states like pennsylvania",Republican

and on the rare chance that amercans decide to import less from canada we can look at the added bonus of a huge drop in our gdp once that happens our current nato contributions will be well over the  of gdp bench mark which nato members are encouraged to pay to support their own troops of course its easy for trump to sow the seeds of discord within nato regarding contributions hes not paying for healthcare

the  tariff on canadian products should also be extended to electricity which the province of quebec provides to keep the lights and air conditioning functioning in the state of new york image trump tower in darkness what a pretty sight you can always buy candles from canadajust add

worldnews,"while i can understand there are genuine problems that result from a liberal trade policy ie it being difficult to manufacture things in america i dont understand the tariffs from a purely political perspective

if you accept the idea that harris lost because of resentment over the economy which is not an unreasonable assumption it beggars belief that trumps first action will be supposedly to bring in tariffs which will increase the price of goods for every day americans a lot of people seemed to vote from trump because they felt they were better off  years ago before the inflation crisis so why the hell would trump crank it up further on a purely retail politics level its a bizarre move to make life harder for people when your pitch was life was harder under the other guy",Neutral

worldnews,not true hell be directing it to russia instead,Neutral
worldnews,for what its worth a highranking trump aid is on record saying that trump may dramatically increase weapons to ukraine to force russia to come to the table trumps  goal is to make a deal if russia is in an advantageous position and not particularly interested in negotiating they might get a little surprise about what happens when you get between trump and one of his egoinflater issues,Neutral
worldnews,"i thought of it a month ago i even said it to my wife if trump wins you know biden is going to rush arms to ukraine its exactly what presidents do in situations like this every single time 

i am also not shocked that people are clutching their pearls over something so obvious and predictable",Neutral
worldnews,two years ago it was still expected he would likely run against trump while having a hostile to biden house  ever since he opted not to run against he should have increased as much as possible  but lets not let perfect be the enemy of good in this case,Neutral
worldnews,"he fucked up a long time ago being timid is not how you fight a war the opportunity for ukraine to have made advancements was early on when they still had the element of shock over a poorly trained undermanned and equiped enemy many may still be poorly trained but there are so many more along with layers of defenses

 i will never fathom what the fuck this administration was thinking putting limits on the weapons we sent and only sending handfuls at a time this might even be over by now if biden got away from the vietnam style of thinking lets handcuff ukraine use of weapons and only give a little at a time

 feel even worse for the families that have lost loved ones due to this protracted war",Neutral

now that they lost he can do whatever he wants",Neutral

worldnews,lets just say that the conflict in ukraine is not popular among the russianfunded media and corresponding watchers,Neutral

worldnews,they should just help ukraine take putin out and leave trump with the mess the world will be a far better place,Neutral

worldnews,it was a perfect phone call,Neutral
worldnews,"trump himself has not yet approved a specific peace plan the wsj said with a former national security council aide noting that he makes his own calls on national security issues many times in the moment



well thats comforting",Neutral

worldnews,zelensky is doing his best,Neutral
worldnews,zelenskyy is a smart man he knows that the key to trumps heart is through his ego so hes really fullthrottling with the superlatives when describing his interactions with him lets hope that it works out well for him trump doesnt give a crap about ukraine and cant be made to care,Neutral
worldnews,if the russia ukraine war suddenly stop its gonna make trump look really freaking good at international diplomacy,Neutral
worldnews,honestly as much as i hate trump if he can somehow end the ukraine war without compromising ukraines future as a free democracy safe from russia i will give him credit but i doubt this will happen,Neutral
worldnews,"my reallyoutthere hope is that trump has a secret grudge about being used by putin and turns on him

as weve seen in this crazy new world of politics no bad news seems to stick to him so if putin did have something on trump he can just cry fake news and carry on as usual

trump absolutely backing ukraine to the hilt would be wild to see",Neutral
worldnews,"hes obviously going to see this whether the call went well or not

hes hardly going to say the call was a complete shit show and cause panic among his people and soldiers",Neutral
worldnews,good luck with that,Neutral
worldnews,best case sccenario trump delivers real firepower to ukraine in exchange for rebuilding contracts for us companies and mineral rights for us companies pooptin is forced to retreat from ukraine trump can absolutely sell this as an overwhelming win and tell he singlehandedly ended the war plus strengthened the us economy and created jobs out of it putin can save his face by saying we retreated from ukraine bc the denazification process was successful everyone knows anyway that he is full of shit that would be the ebst case scenario imo,Neutral
worldnews,zelensky understands that you just have to suck up to trump if you want something from him i hope that he is able to play him to save his people,Neutral
worldnews,"on wednesday the wall street journal wsj reported that despite differing views on peace terms among trumps advisors there was consensus on freezing the war along the current front lines  leaving some  of ukrainian territory under russian control  and forcing ukraine to temporarily suspend its efforts to join nato

this is what happens when you put morons in power

freezing isnt a neutral thing freezing is conceding to the enemy all enemies love it when they attack take whats yours and then the situation is frozen meaning they get to keep what they took",Neutral
worldnews,"throughout his electoral campaign trump had spoken in increasingly negative terms about zelensky at one point calling him the greatest salesman on earth

i am shocked that trump would share that title with anybody else haha",Neutral
worldnews,whether you like trump or not if he actually manages to get russia to end the war and withdraw from ukraine that is a net good to the world and should be commended lets hope he manages,Neutral
worldnews,is he the acting president already,Neutral
worldnews,and then trump shared the plan with putin,Neutral
worldnews,yeah he totally wants to end the war so does putin im sure hell even help z and putin negotiate a deal ukraine gets to fall back and russia gets the land grab they want,Neutral
worldnews,he has to kiss trumps ass now for his own countrys survival and he will absolutely be left hanging and robustly fucked over,Neutral
worldnews,so either theres a plea deal and trump gets to say i ended the war even though it involves ukraine giving up land or putin pauses the war allowing trump to say i ended the war after either trump dissolves the sanctions on russia lets putin recharge and refill the  and troops then,Neutral
worldnews,the problem with trump is hell say anything to a persons face to make them happy as soon as they are in another context hell say or do the opposite,Neutral
worldnews,very possible that putin backs off entirely but only during gop terms then launches again when they leave office christ i hate geopolitics,Neutral
worldnews,so basically what everyone thought ukraine having no choice but to surrender and capitulate their territorial integrity to russia while not being able to join nato  nato being the only thing that would legitimately prevent another invasion of ukraine evidenced by the fact that russia invaded them to literally prevent that by keeping them at war anyone who thinks this is the peace of our time is an imbecile this is a win and signal for russia to continue to act as they have acted by exerting themselves on any nation they deem unfit for self governance,Neutral
worldnews,"the biggest issue for the rest of the world is that trump seems to make decisions based on the opinion of the last person he spoke too 

unless zelensky is gonna be calling everyday is impossible to know which direction trump will go in until he does it probably based on whatever the talking head on oan said was the best thing that morning",Neutral
worldnews,i cant believe we are back here again,Neutral
worldnews,he has been doing this for so long we might have forgotten zelensky started off as a comedian actor hopefully he still can play up his audience of one and get ukraine what they needed,Neutral
worldnews,zelensky knows how to play trump its not like its complicated or anything,Neutral
worldnews,i would not be surprised if telling the media the call was excellent was one of the asks from trump,Neutral
worldnews,"wonder if it was the guy he left on hold for  mins the one in the story we had to endure on both joe rogan and the acceptance speech  god awful rambling

i thought it was a space age movie or something i put the phone down but i didnt pick it up for  minutes and he was holding but this spaceship came down and i saw those engines firing and it looked like it was over it was going to smash and then i saw the fire pour out from the left side and it put it straight and it came down so gently and then it wrapped those arms around it and it held it and just like you hold your baby at night your little baby and it was a beautiful thing to see and i called elon i said elon was that you he said yes it was i said who else can do that can russia do it no can china do it no can the united states do it other than you no nobody can do that i said thats why i love you elon that",Neutral
worldnews,so just give up all of your territory to russia and the wars over easy,Neutral
worldnews,my money is that he will provide ukraine with overwhelming firepower plus top notch intel in return for exclusive mineral rights for us companies,Neutral
worldnews,so when trumps team says freeze the current front lines where they are does that also mean that ukraine keeps the russian territory it has captured,Neutral
worldnews,this was in the middle of last year,Neutral

worldnews,if this war ends with both sides satisfied and trump gets credit peoples heads will explode i dont even like the guy but its a good thing when people stop dying crazy that needs to be pointed out,Neutral
worldnews,for people being optimistic around here remember that putin congratulates trump and he ready for a talk with trumps peace plan immediately dont trust these two of them so easily one of the them is a conman and one is an exkgb both have great history of being untrustworthy in their promises be more levelhead,Neutral
