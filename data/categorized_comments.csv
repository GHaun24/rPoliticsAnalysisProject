America as a democracy is slowly crumbling before our eyes, but the world will go on.

The Good:

1. We democratically elected a President. There was no violence (although if the Dems had won, Trump was certainly going to incite more violence). Historically speaking, people get the elected leaders they deserve.

The Bad:

1. Competent Government: There is no question that Kamala would have presided over a competent Federal government. She had sound policies (which btw were incredibly centrist) that are supported by a majority of Americans. Trump will install political hacks and sycophants in all levels of government. How do I know, check schedule F. We are in for bureaucratic nightmares.
2. Economy. The US economy by all measures is the best of the developed world since COVID, by a long shot. Stock market indices are good, inflation has cooled, unemployment is at its lowest sustained levels in years, ,manufacturing jobs roared back under Biden. So essentially Biden took a shitty economy (which BTW was not all of Trump's fault, but he does share quite a bit of blame, his taxation policies have continued the hollowing out of the middle class by transferring the tax burden from the super rich down to lower economic brackets) and landed it perfectly (with help from the Federal Reserve). Trump's policies will have some pretty negative long-term consequences for the U.S. When they say tax cuts, everyone making under $360,000 will see their taxes increase, only those making over $360,000 will see a decrease in their taxes.
3. Environment. Regulations designed to protect human health and welfare will be eroded. When you get pancreatic cancer from PFOA/PFAS I hope you buy a MAGA branded colostomy bag from Team Trump.
4. Education. They are going to continue to devalue education, expect the quality of education in this country to decline.
5. Health Care: We already have a health care system that is in shambles. No western country pays more for health care and has worse outcomes. If you really want to understand why I would highly suggest reading ""America's Bitter Pill"" by Stephen Brill.

The Ugly

1. Hate. America embraced hate like it has never embraced hate before. First election of Trump, yeah, I'll give you a pass for electing him, but second go round, you know exactly who you voted for and why. Don't kid yourself, there have been white nationalist movements in this country going all the way back to the Know-nothings, but MAGA is that on on JP-5. It is cruelty to those that are the most vulnerable amongst us, people of color, immigrants, the marginalized. Those people will lose the most. A President that called large swaths of American citizens ""the enemy"" and turned American's against each other is now going to be there for the next four years.
2. Constitutional Government. Americans elected a President that has continually shown is willing to break the law and ignore the Constitution, the Guardrails are off. The adults that were in the room that recognized the importance of the constitution are gone. All bets are off, we have Full Monty Trump and it is going to be day-after-day constitutional ass-wiping for the next four years. He is who is is, and he will do what he says is going to do, he has also packed the court with ideologues that have skewed versions of the Constitution and the limits of executive authority.
3. Russia. The biggest winner in all of this. While MAGA was popping corks and DEMS were in tears nobody noticed that Russia actively attacked our election. They attacked in the lead-up and they attacked it on election day. This happened and really it should be the lead story. It is also hugely problematic that Twitter (X) is also being used as a propaganda tool for the Russian government. When Musk had shortfalls to purchase, he relied on outside investors including some Middle Eastern and Russian, to front the money. With Musk's contacts with Putin, this is incredibly problematic. I find it interesting that the MAGA crowd, who is virulently anti-communist, is okay with Musk's cozying up to communist and a Presidential candidate that has had multiple off-the-record conversations with Putin. I am not saying that Musk or Trump committed treason, but they are sailing perilously close to the fucking wind here.

There is much more but this is the sad truth. The national media is also to blame here, but probably not for the reason's you think (especially MAGA). We live in a nation that has fully embraced fear and ignorance, we will reap what we sow. Americans are asking the wrong questions. Do we want to live in a country in which the richest control access to the truth? Do we want an economy that destroys the middle class? Do we want to continue to degrade the environment?",Democrat

Most people said they voted based on the economy.  Economists suggest that if Trump does in fact move forward with this plan, it will effect the economy negatively more than tariffs.

Our goober governor will do nothing to stand in Trump’s way. I’m surrounded by dozens of low income apartment blocks that are chock full of THOUSANDS of migrants, most of whom are here undocumented. It is a well known thing, and I don’t see how if this happens that:

 a.) A significant number of my neighbors just don’t flee. I’ve been watching people work like crazy in the last two weeks, no doubt to save up cash in case they need to bug out or already plan to go before Inauguration Day. 


B.) A significant portion of people have convinced themselves this is all talk and will not change a thing…which means occupation. I do not see that being peaceful and only restricted to the undocumented. 

C.) I’m married to a naturalized citizen, and they are easy to find because of the amount of information you must give USCIS. Who was the very first group Stephen Miller made sure to focus on: Naturalized citizens. 

For those of you that say “this isn’t America” or “they can’t do that”, I’ll remind you that for 100 years Black Americans were second class citizens even though the Constitution said they were not. To really drive the point home, I don’t even need to go back to the Jim Crow era.  I need only go to the 1980s and what life was like in low income urban areas during the early days of the War on Drugs during the crack cocaine era. 

Police were trained in paramilitary tactics, used military grade weaponry, and invaded neighborhoods nightly with no or sketchy warrants that ignored due process. All they had to say is “there is crack in that house, all must be arrested or killed no questions asked.” While it has been greatly reduced, the tactics are still used today and they are only eschewed when they get caught.

1. Paper ballots are way less consistent and ~~secure~~ *reliable* compared to voting machines.

4. You don’t need proof of citizenship at the polls.

It would be immediately challenged by protections under the14th and 15th Amendments and the Voting Rights Act, but a corrupt Supreme Court could shove it through.

However, as per Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, states are separately granted the explicit authority to determine Electoral College electors for presidential elections.

Man, I have a huge personal dislike for Donald Trump, so I voted Harris. But dem leadership is utterly moronic. I like Michelle Obama, but she was an idiot calling trump supporters racists last week. Just because I dislike trump doesn’t mean all his supporters are racist.

Running Biden in the first place was an utterly moronic move. Should have had a primary in the first place. I get why they didn’t when Biden dropped out, but they’re idiots for getting in that situation in the first place. Ignoring the border, bringing up gun control, ignoring inflation.

I make (low) six figures and I struggle to support myself and my gf who has medical issues. There’s something broken there. Ivory tower liberalism with no introspection is a huge part of why the Dems lost. It’s a bunch of academics with no real world experience who are so stuck in their own bubbles that they can’t change or realize how out of touch they are with reality.

So it isn't enough that he and he alone lose the election, but all those that are up for election in Congress, the Senate, state governors, legislators, even down to council persons, mayors and school boards need to be voted out of incumbencies and voted against in challenges and elections. Trump isn't doing this alone. He has a huge following in every channel of government and if all.we do is just the kingpin, there'll always be an underlying to pick up where he left off.

For those who think Trump is just being stupid, you weren't paying attention when he said he liked the tariffs of the 1890s. 

That was the time when most of the federal government's revenue came from tariffs, because *there were no personal income taxes.*

And of course, if there are tariffs on other countries, there will be a trade war. Which will decrease US exports, and likely cause a recession. 

Meanwhile, I wouldn't count on Trump eliminating all personal income taxes for everyone. Republicans could just get rid of the top earned income tax bracket. 

And then, reduce capital gains tax rates. As capital gains on asset sales and qualified dividends constitute the bulk of the very wealthy's income. Most of them don't make much at all in earned income.

So then tarrifs + continued earned income tax rates for the 99% means the 99% will be paying a much higher share of the federal government's budget.",Neutral

I first saw a woman begging in 1975 and my friends thought she was a prostitute. That same year I first saw a small pile of men sleeping on a grate to keep warm. For the last 50 years tenant advocates have been warning that government policies that favored landlords and developers were destroying the cheap housing stock. 

Less dramatic, but equally intense has been the change in ""security"". Before 2001, you could go to an airport and walk your friends almost to the plane. You could hang out in an airport and watch planes take off, just for fun. You didn't have to be there 3 hours early to go through security. You could bring anything legal on the plane with you--things like knitting needles and penknives and scissors. On domestic flights, no one looked at your luggage. No one would dream of making you go through a metal detector and take your shoes off. You could go into almost any government or commercial building without metal detectors.

All the while doing everything they can to bring in as many people as possible to a nation they are just going to get thrown back out of, instead of exercising some actual humanity and empathy and doing the right thing for those people (since they clearly don’t give a shit about the people of this country) by denying them entry into our country.

■ blackmailer of President Zelinksy, the state of Georgia, and many others. Many of his attempts are RECORED.

■ candidate who wants to destroy our US Constitution and our government,

• in many jurisdictions, you are not allowed to vote if you are a convicted felon.

■ disrespected Senator John McCain because he was captured, 

■ destroyer of the free press by stating he will remove the licenses / ability to function or do their jobs from numerous newspapers, shows, and specific analysts or reporters,

■ dictator as of day one in office, 

■ facist,

■ human being who:

• destroyed the lives of many people who disagreed with him,

• insists he is right and everyone else is wrong,

• is unfaithful to all of his wives,

• makes fun of the didabled,

• has disrespected our brave men and women of the military,

• has not answered for his numerous financial issues (not paying any taxes, hiding money, Emoluments Clause violations, two billion dollars received from Saidia Arabia [given to his son-in-law], etc.)

• has not related the fact he is building a huge Trump complex n Russia,

• has promised to arrest, imprison, or deport people he does not like or who do not support him.

• plans on changing our way of life so that he can be Putin #2,

• started and supports the insurrection and the insurrestionslists,

• was made to legally change his racially prejudiced real estate practices.

■ supporter of alternative facts (liar) who demands that his sycophants do the same, and

■ twice impeached former President,

>Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with X to prevent information about his running mate JD Vance from being posted on the social media platform, a move that resulted in the journalist who revealed the information being kicked off the site, according to reports.

>The former president’s team contacted X, owned by the billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, about a 271-page document compiled by his campaign to vet Vance that was linked to by Ken Klippenstein, an independent journalist, the New York Times has reported.

>X responded by blocking links to the material, claiming that it contained sensitive personal information such as the Ohio US senator’s social security number, and banned Klippenstein from the platform.

>The materials published by Klippenstein on his Substack in September appear to be related to a hack of the Trump campaign earlier this year, which the FBI has linked to Iran. Documents from the hack have been shared with several media outlets, which have chosen to not publish them.

>Media outlets did not reach the same decision when they gave significant attention to files from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign that were hacked and leaked by Russian intelligence before she ultimately lost that election to Trump. At one point Trump also said he hoped Russia would be “able to find” some of Clinton’s files.

>The leaked dossier on JD Vance is revealing in all the things it doesn’t say

>The removal of the material from X has highlighted the increasingly strident support of Musk, the world’s richest person, for Trump’s attempt to return to the White House after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. After buying Twitter in 2022, Musk said that he was an advocate of free speech and the open sharing of information, even if it offended either political party.

>Last week, Musk appeared at a Pennsylvania rally alongside the former president, performing an awkward jump on stage before declaring that “I’m not just Maga – I’m dark Maga” while invoking the Republican nominee’s Make America Great Again slogan.

>Musk added that “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win in November against Kamala Harris, complaining that she and her fellow Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your right to vote, effectively”.

>Klippenstein, whose X account has been restored following the New York Times reporting, said in a Substack post on Friday that Musk had purchased political influence and “is wielding that influence in increasingly brazen ways”.

>“The real election interference here is that a social media corporation can decree certain information unfit for the American electorate,” he wrote.

>“Two of our most sacred rights as Americans are the freedoms of speech and assembly, online or otherwise. It is a national humiliation that these rights can be curtailed by anyone with enough digits in their bank account.”

>Musk is set to appear at further Trump rallies – and he may even knock on voters’ doors for the campaign in Pennsylvania in the coming week. He has funded a political action entity called America Pac that has spent around $80m to help Trump reach voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania.",Republican

Also... We export more than we import from USA. By about 150 billion €.

Want to know what the top 3 imports from USA are?

1. Crude oil and other petroleum
2. Medicinal and pharmacetical products (I know that this refers specifically to active compounds, which are turned into medicine here.)
3. Natural gas.

So... What do we buy from USA? Energy and oil. What do we export to USA? Refined products, machinery and equipment, and medical/surgical/pharmaceutical products. We don't buy consumer good from USA; They buy that stuff from us. For example... We sell Alcoholic beverages to USA for over 8 billion €, but we only buy 1 billion worth. We sell twice as much base metal products than we buy from USA.

And I love this. 

* Alcoholic beverages: Import 1 billion €; export 8 billion.
* Non-alcoholic beverages: import 69 million €; export 1,1 billion €.
* Footwear imports from USA 162 million €; exports over 3 billion.
* Steel pipes, tubes, hollow profiles and fittings = Import \~340 million €; export over 3 billion €.
* Paper and cardboard = Import \~730 million; export 2,6 billion €.
* Food processing equipment: import 202 million; export 1,7 billion €.
* Aluminium = import 414 million; export 1,5 billion €.
* Articles of clothing and textiles: Import 165 million €; export 1,47 billion €.
* Prepared or preserved root vegetables: Import 90 million; export 1,4 billion
* Clay and refratory construction mateirals: Import 43 million; Export 1,25 billion €.
* Lime, cement, and fabricated construction materials (Except glass and clay): Import 19 million; Export 850 million.
* Sugar confectionary:  import 28 million; export 617 million;

First, Mexico and Canada are our largest trading partners other than China. They combined, account for 28% of domestic imports.

Canada accounts for about 50% of our domestic crude imports; Mexico accounts for about 9%. On average they combined, represent 60% of our crude oil imports.

Mexico represents 36% of our automobile and automobile part imports. Canada is another 15-20%. They represent more than 55% of our automotive sector imports combined.

Canada represents 7% of our lumber imports but notably, its 80% of our softwood lumber imports. Softwood is used in construction. Hardwood is used in things like furniture.

Mexico and Canada represent 14% of our agricultural imports.

We import 5% of our steel and aluminum imports from Canada.

20% of our electronics imports comes from Mexico.

A lot of people seemed to vote from Trump because they felt they were better off 4 years ago, before the inflation crisis. So why the hell would Trump crank it up further?
