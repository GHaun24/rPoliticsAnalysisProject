"When the ACA is killed, folks are going to become reacquainted with “pre-existing conditions” and subsequent denial of insurance/coverage. 

Folks are gonna hate it."
"Everyone that voted for Trump will blame all woes on everyone that didn't vote for Trump. This script has been playing out for 8 FUCKING YEARS. 

They are trees voting for the axe and will blame wind when they are cut down"
“Why do things cost more now? He said tariffs would fix the economy.”
Just wait till the tariffs kick in
"It’s gonna bite them in the ass, sooner than they think. Then victim mode will set in and they’ll find someone else to blame."
"We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope. - Martin Luther King, Jr"
I think it’s clear that a good chunk of Americans are incapable of reflection.
"When people don’t get a stimulus check, and they still have to pay taxes, and food prices don’t go down, people are going to be really upset."
"I don’t care that it’s a republican that won, I care that it was Trump. We will now have another 4 years of absolute chaos, unrest, and hate."
It was an IQ test. It went worse than expected. 
I imagine there are going to be a lot of “I told you so” posts by the time 2026 midterms come around.
"Watch as regulations get scaled back.


Environmental protections lifted.


Laws rewritten.


Rights taken away.


Lives lost.


Theo-oligarchy institution takes over.


All for fucking memes and apathy.


Goddamn America, you are special."
I already regret it ... my coworkers and family are giddy like this is the second coming of Jesus ... I hate it here.
Are Americans so dumb they think this imbecile will help them because their groceries are a bit more expensive.  They are in for a world of hurt. Dumb idiots.
It's so cute to think Trump voters will regret this. They know exactly what they're getting and they're doubling down on it. Their lives will get worse and they'll still blame everyone but the people they're happy electing. Facebook and Twitter will keep telling them of leftist conspiracies causing all their problems and they'll continue to lap it up and ask for seconds.
"Dem turnout:

66 million in 2016   
81 million in 2020   
66 million in 2024

This isnt a victory of Rs, they actually had 3 million less voters this year over 2020, this is a colossal failure of democractic voters to actually show up to vote."
Yep. Most of the people who voted for him will be negativity affected by his policies. I'm an upper-middle class white dude.. I'll be just fine. I voted for Kamala cause I'm not a selfish asshole. 
"Interest rates will be slashed. Prices and housing costs will soar out of control. Wages will freeze, wealth will flow upward at an ever greater rate. Until the whole thing comes to a halt, because only the few are left with spending money. Just like the end of any Monopoly game. And the damage may not be fully felt until 5 years from now. The presidents after may not be able to repair it. All empires fall. This could very well be chapter 2."
"
WTF...The man lost the last election BY  over 7 million votes, and now, after all he HAS said and done, he's won the popular vote with most voting Americans voting for him. I'm in the backyard right now yelling what Charleston Heston yelled in the Planet of the Apes ....""It's a madhouse,"" and now Trump will tell the federal prosecutors something else Charleston Heston said... ""Get your stinking paws off me... you damn dirty prosecutors """
Never underestimate the power of dumb people in large groups.
Where are the clowns claiming voter fraud now???
"The US did this to themselves with decades of anti-intellectual dogmatism.

It seems that voodoo economics, discrimination, and religious fundamentalism are core characteristics of contemporary America."
"Those idiots/deplorables/garbage won't regret shit. Recession in 2025? ""Its Biden' fault"". Russia invades Belarus and Finland? ""It's Hillary's fault. Waves of migrants crossing through border? ""It's Hunter's Laptops fault"". These people are in a cult now, they will drink any Coolaid, even if you tell them there's cyanide in it."
As a non american: i’ve never been so disapointed in america and I’ve followed the Bush administration
"Deporting our agricultural workforce. A tariff war.

Yeah. It's going to get bad. Real bad.

Those voters angry about food/rent prices and voted for Trump are about to experience a hard lesson."
Yeah the entire fucking planet will regret America’s decision to become an openly fascist nation.
"America? The entire world will feel the repercussions of reelecting Trump, not just America."
"We already have. I didn’t vote for this moron. I am disgusted to share the confines of this country with such ignorant, hateful, scum"
Why are Trumpsters such mean and rude people?
"Man I hope he goes through with his promise with increasing import taxes..

Its going to be funny as hell watching all his supporters wonder why everything has substantially gone up in price.."
"> When someone tells you who they are, believe them.

America is a country where a majority of the voting population is perfectly happy putting a senile, rapey, racist, convicted criminal and fraudster into the white house even after already experiencing 4 years of his lunacy. This is just what America is. Full stop."
"At this point, we deserve it. I had hope for America, but after last night, it's clear the people want this. So let us have it. Let the foundations we built crumble and true hardship set it. Maybe it will make the hard-core trumpers realize their mistake, and  the ""undecideds"" regret their complacency."
[removed]
This country deserves everything it gets for what it's done
Well good thing is democrats won’t have to worry about voter turnout next time because there probably won’t be a next time…
"Probably. I'm waiting for the public school system stuff to be overhauled. When that starts happening, you will see the results of this outcome."
"Sad to say but the electorate has bought their ticket and now they get to take the ride and deal with the consequences.

Turns out voting has effects"
I don’t understand. The guy completely botched his handling of a pandemic. Then convinced people vaccines and masks somehow infringed on their rights leading to more and more senseless deaths and he is somehow rewarded with another term? Oh and convinced people that somehow the experts on the matter were the bad guys. How do people connect with this man?
No. This country will not regret a single thing. They will cheer and applaud with grins on their faces as we all get lead to slaughter. We deserve every bit of Hell this fuck face is going to unleash.
I just want to point out that this is from The Hill. This isn't from Slate or Commondreams. The Hill is center-right
"I mainly feel sorry for all the people in Palestine, Lebanon, and Ukraine who will face the consequences but couldn't vote. But most of all, I feel sorry for our habitat and future generations."
"America is over, its people are rotten and it will take generations to filter out the filth if ever"
"Apparently 53% of the country needs a serious, bracing reality check. I hope Trump does deport all these latinos' families and drowns the middle class in taxes because of tariffs. I hope all those Gen X'ers protesting on college campuses who didn't want to vote for Kamala because ""she's a genocider"" sleep well when they see what's in store for Palestine's future during Trump's presidency.

EDIT: Sorry, Gen Z'ers... It's been a long night."
It's not the decision I made and I regret it regardless
yeah we fucking know 😭
"I'm not going to be able to retire, am I? They'll look social security to save Elon some taxes, and I'll die at my keyboard."
So Russia finally won the Cold War with a knock out when America punched itself in the face.
"I hope every middle to low income maga supporter gets exactly what is fucking coming to them: higher prices thanks to tariffs, no welfare, no healthcare no help at all. 

drown in fucking despair and poverty you fucking fools"
"As an American, I already regret my country's decision to elect Trump. 🥺😢

We look like a bunch of gun loving, racists, misogynistic, imbeciles."
This country is full of idiots who think they’re smart.
"The world is not going to end.

America as a democracy is slowly crumbling before our eyes, but the world will go on.

The Good:

1. We democratically elected a President. There was no violence (although if the Dems had won, Trump was certainly going to incite more violence). Historically speaking, people get the elected leaders they deserve.

The Bad:

1. Competent Government: There is no question that Kamala would have presided over a competent Federal government. She had sound policies (which btw were incredibly centrist) that are supported by a majority of Americans. Trump will install political hacks and sycophants in all levels of government. How do I know, check schedule F. We are in for bureaucratic nightmares.
2. Economy. The US economy by all measures is the best of the developed world since COVID, by a long shot. Stock market indices are good, inflation has cooled, unemployment is at its lowest sustained levels in years, ,manufacturing jobs roared back under Biden. So essentially Biden took a shitty economy (which BTW was not all of Trump's fault, but he does share quite a bit of blame, his taxation policies have continued the hollowing out of the middle class by transferring the tax burden from the super rich down to lower economic brackets) and landed it perfectly (with help from the Federal Reserve). Trump's policies will have some pretty negative long-term consequences for the U.S. When they say tax cuts, everyone making under $360,000 will see their taxes increase, only those making over $360,000 will see a decrease in their taxes.
3. Environment. Regulations designed to protect human health and welfare will be eroded. When you get pancreatic cancer from PFOA/PFAS I hope you buy a MAGA branded colostomy bag from Team Trump.
4. Education. They are going to continue to devalue education, expect the quality of education in this country to decline.
5. Health Care: We already have a health care system that is in shambles. No western country pays more for health care and has worse outcomes. If you really want to understand why I would highly suggest reading ""America's Bitter Pill"" by Stephen Brill.

The Ugly

1. Hate. America embraced hate like it has never embraced hate before. First election of Trump, yeah, I'll give you a pass for electing him, but second go round, you know exactly who you voted for and why. Don't kid yourself, there have been white nationalist movements in this country going all the way back to the Know-nothings, but MAGA is that on on JP-5. It is cruelty to those that are the most vulnerable amongst us, people of color, immigrants, the marginalized. Those people will lose the most. A President that called large swaths of American citizens ""the enemy"" and turned American's against each other is now going to be there for the next four years.
2. Constitutional Government. Americans elected a President that has continually shown is willing to break the law and ignore the Constitution, the Guardrails are off. The adults that were in the room that recognized the importance of the constitution are gone. All bets are off, we have Full Monty Trump and it is going to be day-after-day constitutional ass-wiping for the next four years. He is who is is, and he will do what he says is going to do, he has also packed the court with ideologues that have skewed versions of the Constitution and the limits of executive authority.
3. Russia. The biggest winner in all of this. While MAGA was popping corks and DEMS were in tears nobody noticed that Russia actively attacked our election. They attacked in the lead-up and they attacked it on election day. This happened and really it should be the lead story. It is also hugely problematic that Twitter (X) is also being used as a propaganda tool for the Russian government. When Musk had shortfalls to purchase, he relied on outside investors including some Middle Eastern and Russian, to front the money. With Musk's contacts with Putin, this is incredibly problematic. I find it interesting that the MAGA crowd, who is virulently anti-communist, is okay with Musk's cozying up to communist and a Presidential candidate that has had multiple off-the-record conversations with Putin. I am not saying that Musk or Trump committed treason, but they are sailing perilously close to the fucking wind here.

There is much more but this is the sad truth. The national media is also to blame here, but probably not for the reason's you think (especially MAGA). We live in a nation that has fully embraced fear and ignorance, we will reap what we sow. Americans are asking the wrong questions. Do we want to live in a country in which the richest control access to the truth? Do we want an economy that destroys the middle class? Do we want to continue to degrade the environment?"
"My father told me something when I turned 18 that always seems to ring true..

“Never underestimate the stupidity of the American people”"
I hope RFK ends up being too weird for Trump in the end
"I can't wait for these Trumpsters to meet the consequence of their own actions.

""I didn't know they were going to deport MY \[family/coworker/friend\].""  
""Wait I was going to retire soon what do you mean Social Security is going to be exhausted years earlier than anticipated?""  
""Why didn't the government give us the information regarding the hurricane that just flooded/destroyed my house?""  
""Why is there a measles outbreak in my community?""  
""I don't get it, the economy is going great why are the electronic gifts I want to buy for my family not in stock at any of the stores?""  
""Why did the price of my groceries not go down? I thought CHINA is paying the tariffs.""   
""It's outrageous, my daughter needs to visit a Planned Parenthood and the closest one is many states away!""  
""The company I work for got a huge tax break so why did I just get let go?""  
""We finally stopped giving billions to Ukraine so why is the homeless issue in my city not solved yet?""  
""Why the fuck did Elon Musk just remove \[INSERT AGENCY\] we really relied on their services."""
Yep. The people of America have voted against themselves and didn’t even realize it.
Most of the world will regret this decision.

"Exactly this. I have lupus. My one medication alone is 8,000 a month. Without it my body will kill itself, it’s already trying to kill itself. Now with preexisting conditions potentially coming back….i can’t afford my meds to simply survive."
I’ve been saying this. A whole bunch of folks have no conception of what will happen when they gut the ACA.  Most voters under 40 don’t really even fully get what ramifications of this.
"My whole career circles around the ACA and the ADA.  The ADA has only been around since 1992.  Legislatively, it's still in its teenage years.  The ACA is an infant.  I'm going back to school because I'm going to be out of a career if either/or get repealed.  The NLRB is being challenged at SCOTUS brought by Amazon / Microsoft and other oligarch companies to take away our right to dispute labor law violations and that's one step away from gutting OSHA and other protections.  When HIPAA gets demolished, our employers will be able to choose not to hire us because they don't like what's in our medical records.  I have mental health issues, I've had an abortion, etc.  I'm also headed toward middle age.  How long before, as a woman, I'm considered unemployable?  My husband is disabled and on SSA.  I'll have to get a second job if his benefits are cut.  He can't work or it'll kill him.  I want him to live so I won't have any choice but to kill myself for our survival.  I'm so intimately familiar with how fucked we're all going to be this as the dismantling begins.  I tried my hardest to educate people on what's going to come for us.  Nobody believed.  Aside from Reddit, I am in a sea of Red."
"The VA uses ACA to support it's vets, but vets voted against it. Good luck once it's gone, you know the republicans stance on disabled and veteran folk and you happen to be both."
"They won’t want Obamacare, just the ACA. (And yes, they’re often too fucking stupid to know it’s the same thing.)"

All the diabetics in the south going to be screwed. 
My wife and her sister have Crohns. Their dad voted for Trump. Poor thing was crying this morning because she is so scared of what's going to happen to her. She didn't ask for Crohns and shouldn't be fucked even more because of it. It's already expensive enough to be born with a pre-existing condition.
"I have a son born with heart defects that have been surgically repaired, but not forever. He is a pre-existing condition. I also have a godmother who survived cancer twice. She’s gonna be really upset when her insurance drops her as too costly of a risk. I will remind them that my son may not have coverage for the next surgery he needs, I may not speak to them ever again."
This absolutely terrifies me.  Anyone with medical issues in their family should be terrified.  Maybe even worse than pre-existing conditions is lifetime caps on benefits.  One good round of cancer could invalidate you for health care for the rest of your life.  My only hope is that they're so busy ratfucking the environment and the education system that they don't get around to this in time.
Just wait till JD Vance creates two risk pools - one for younger people and one for older people. Suddenly you’ll have millions of people with completely unaffordable insurance. At this point I’m done - if the leopard eats their face I don’t care. If they cut Medicare - I’ll just smile at my in-laws and say “That’s really tough. Oh well.”
Make America Great Depression Again
Slugs for salt!!
They're going to need scapegoats and that's when it's going to really get ugly
its your duty to remind them who they voted for when the time comes
It’s like Texas blaming democrats even though the GOP has been in power for decades
But it won't be his fault. That is all he has to say and this election proves that.
"I’m in my 30’s and I play Fortnite because I use my time wisely. One of my friends was talking about trump fixing the economy with tariffs. I politely asked him what a tariff was and how it would fix inflation. He got upset, left the game, blocked me immediately. Trump voters in a nutshell."
[deleted]
Have we tried jailing the reporters yet?  Maybe that will help.
"The correct response to this, when talking to a trump voter, is ""because of your vote"". Never let them live this down."
"Second Great Depression. 

One of the reasons we went through the Great Depression was because of high tariffs from the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act."
"Then the disastrous economic effects will be left for the next Dem president to fix while still being blamed for it, the poor bastard. Then the Republican after that will reap the political benefit of the Dem's policies before dismantling them. Repeat ad nauseum."
They’re going to strangle us. 
The only possible upside is he basically never does what he says he will do... So maybe no tariffs...
"Already made a vow only to purchase groceries for the next 4 years. No luxury consumer products. Food, mortgage, insurance and that's it. No phones, TVs, cars, computers just basic life necessities. Probably a gun though."
They will blame it on the Democrats. They are incapable of critical thinking.
"Yeah it doesnt matter

Everything in their misery is because of Democrats fault

Everything in their gain is because of dJT credit

Its that simple and they wont change their ideas. Its a political environment we live in"
Unfortunately the damage this will do will take decades to recover from
Currently grading assignments where I asked students to justify their responses. These college students don’t have any idea what a cogent argument looks like. It’s terrifying.
"Yep.  They'll never regret what they seem incapable of remembering and connecting to current events.  They'll accept whatever misdirected blame is spoon-fed to them.


They will get everything they deserve, but unfortunately, so will the rest of the planet."
I probably would feel less worse if I knew he lost the popular vote. But my belief that most in this country are decent is gone. I won't ever get that back. Now I know a majority is just evil and hateful.
"They'll pay a whole lot more for everything, face a recession, kill countless women through abortion bans, give away Ukraine to a dictator...

But hey, they probably won't have tampons in men's bathrooms and trans athletes probably won't be able to compete in the US. You know, the really important issues."
I mean are WE capable of reflection? We clearly did not anticipate that Trump would win in a landslide and that all of America would veer strongly right. Why did this happen?
"Specifically the DNC.  Say what you will about the voters, but the lost voters from 2020 shows that having a candidate picked by the DNC, and not the voters in a primary is ruining the Democrats chances.  And not just this election, but 2016 as well."
Just wait until they have to pay the tariffs of 20% on a lot of things…
At the Democrats. They’ll be upset at the Democrats. And immigrants. And whoever Trump tells them to blame.
"Our best hope is that he's too tired to care. He looked exhausted last night. He can't run again. And he's in his final years. He's got nothing to play for. Hopefully he's mostly a lame duck this time. Ukraine is still fucked though and probably won't be on the map once his presidency is over, and Putin will have a decent hold on the US forever more."
Straight facts. The critical thinkers are being out bred and this is the result.
And a morality check failed that too.

"""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."" - Maya Angelou

No, those other times, that was okay because it didn't hurt me. But this one might, so clearly, he's joking."
"Ignoring the humanitarian issues here.

Most people said they voted based on the economy.  Economists suggest that if Trump does in fact move forward with this plan, it will effect the economy negatively more than tariffs.

The theory is simple.  Many people with questionable status work in the food industry.  Processing meat and farming being two of the big ones.  If these people aren't there to do their jobs, then the work doesn't get done OR it gets done at a much higher cost.  So you'll see an immediate price increase on everything in the grocery store as a result.

Exactly what Trump voters didn't want, will absolutely happen under Trump."

People voted for chaos and fascism. That is what they will get. That’s democracy.
"Oh man, it's like he's absolutely going to do the thing we were fucking warning you about

Edit: This is more a statement towards the Democrats that stayed home.  I couldn't care less what the people who voted for him think."
"It’ll cost billions to just deport them, billions in lost tax revenue and millions in lost real estate earnings. If you want a depression, this is how you get one."
We definitely have a national emergency. And it’s definitely not the immigrants
Inb4 his defenders say “He’s obvs just being sarcastic”
People think groceries are expensive now.  Wait until the magic of tariffs and the overnight evaporation of cheap labor.
"For many of you this is an existential threat. For me it’s in my backyard. I live in an immigrant heavy neighborhood in a large blue metro unfortunately in a purple state that went red. Our goober governor will do nothing to stand in Trump’s way. I’m surrounded by dozens of low income apartment blocks that are chock full of THOUSANDS of migrants, most of whom are here undocumented. It is a well known thing, and I don’t see how if this happens that:

 a.) A significant number of my neighbors just don’t flee. I’ve been watching people work like crazy in the last two weeks, no doubt to save up cash in case they need to bug out or already plan to go before Inauguration Day. 


B.) A significant portion of people have convinced themselves this is all talk and will not change a thing…which means occupation. I do not see that being peaceful and only restricted to the undocumented. 

C.) I’m married to a naturalized citizen, and they are easy to find because of the amount of information you must give USCIS. Who was the very first group Stephen Miller made sure to focus on: Naturalized citizens. 

For those of you that say “this isn’t America” or “they can’t do that”, I’ll remind you that for 100 years Black Americans were second class citizens even though the Constitution said they were not. To really drive the point home, I don’t even need to go back to the Jim Crow era.  I need only go to the 1980s and what life was like in low income urban areas during the early days of the War on Drugs during the crack cocaine era. 

Police were trained in paramilitary tactics, used military grade weaponry, and invaded neighborhoods nightly with no or sketchy warrants that ignored due process. All they had to say is “there is crack in that house, all must be arrested or killed no questions asked.” While it has been greatly reduced, the tactics are still used today and they are only eschewed when they get caught. 

I wish I could end on something hopeful, but my PTSD from growing up in SE Queens and Atlanta during that era is firing at 2000 degrees. Make preparations people, remember the Constitution derives its power from the people."
"With Trump admitting that he's going to declare a National Emergency in order to utilize Guard troops to deport immigrants, what is stopping him from declaring Dems and other political detractors as national security threats?"
"As a German, the term “mass deportations” always rings several alarm bells."
"If he declares a national emergency, it suspends laws. He could seize private property, suspend travel between states, send in the military to states, temporarily appoint officers in the military, use private property for military purposes, and a whole bunch of other fun things an autocrat would love. 

Congress can remove the order after a certain amount of time but it would have to be veto proof."
" Of course, that's why his defense secretary has zero experience—he wants someone who'll follow orders without question."
This is how you first get American troops into American streets: A faux National Emergency. The next time it will be easier and they will be used against citizens. Inflation is just the byproduct. This is Fascism for real. We are there. Forget Posse Comitatus. The Constitution has been trashed. He will stay in power until he dies. And then he may have an appointed successor.

"People also need to realize this isn't going to just hit ""illegals"". What they define as ""illegal"" will be down to when your local ICE agent or deputized LEO had lunch and how cranky they're feeling.

As a green card holder, I'm living in fear that documented immigrants are going to get swept up in this and separated from families. You don't cast a net this wide and recklessly without getting some fish you weren't aiming for. And I have zero faith in the Trump administration's ability or even desire to undertake due process.

So, as a documented immigrant to this country, I'm never going to forgive anybody that voted for Trump. And I'm never going to forget."
I’m watching the fall of my country in realtime… it’s incredible that Russia actually managed to win the Cold War after all this time. GG I guess
"Oh, nothing bad can happen with this, right. Right?!"
What will Trump bros do when strawberries are $25 a pound and they can’t pick up day laborers in the home deport parking lot anymore
Remember when he asked Congress Republicans to not pass the Democrats border reform bill because he wanted to campaign on the issue?
I hope all these apathetic people that can’t find a job and blame women for being broke are ready to be forced into working the jobs that immigrants mostly worked. Those sitting at home mad that a woman is about to graduate college with a career lined up instead of brushing crumbs off your chest to sleep with you will not have a chance to work unpaid overtime at minimum wage in agriculture or construction. Unemployment will be below 1% with compelled labor.
"And his supporters are still doubling down on this xenophobic bullshit. Honestly, if you openly support Trump, you're out of my life. I don't care if you're family, you could be my best friend. If you openly support this man, you are a fucking fascist and frankly I see you as a threat."
"When he declares a national emergency, that suspends laws.

That's why, that's the reason.  Suspend laws.  You can get away with more crimes that way."
So can national emergencies be declared arbitrarily.  Like can Biden declare a national emergency and cancel the transfer of power.  How does this work?
"It really can happen here, it seems"
"This article isn’t addressing a huge piece of this.  The country of origin must agree to take them back.  They almost all refuse as a general rule.

"We'll be seeing a lot of things like this. ""Sorry Mr. President you can't do that unless it's an emergency"" Ok, so declare it an emergency. Great, now he can do that. 

From the first day in office he'll declare we're a nation in crisis and everything from having his secretary bringing him burgers and coke to declaring martial law is going to be an ""Emergency"" 

Like any narcissist, every text message from him is going to be labeled 911."
"If you think this will only affect immigrants, think again. Hitler used the Reichstag Fire to declare an emergency in order to eliminate rights *for everyone*.

""The Reichstag Fire Decree, issued on February 28, 1933, in response to the Reichstag Fire, suspended many civil liberties in Germany. This decree, officially called the *Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State*, **was used by the Nazis to suppress political opposition and consolidate power**.    
The decree suspended key civil liberties, including:   
- Habeas corpus   
- Freedom of expression   
- Freedom of the press    
- The right to public assembly     
- The right of free association

"JFC... 

He convinced people that immigrants are the reasons for their problems instead of his own party's policies. 

[It's amazing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM) 

Illegal immigrants aren't taking your jobs, they commit less violent crime than the average American populace, and most illegal immigrants are due to **visa overstays.**

So when they only go after brown people, we will know that it's all just ignorant racism mixed with absolute harmful stupidity. 

It will make us look like the monsters we are..."
Declare a national emergency to consolidate his power...That sounds familiar. I faintly recall some Austrian dude doing something similar in my country.
"In the Netherlands we also have a far right, somewhat fascist, government right now. They tried to do exactly this: use emergency legislature in order to stop asylum seekers from entering the country. It didn’t work, because they were stopped by the court. Now they want to deport Moroccans who have lived here for 3 generations, claiming they are antisemitists. 

This whole thing is a very scary worldwide trend. I fear for the state of the world."
"When is Kristallnacht going to happen?  How will they determine if one is an illegal?  Will they only select black, brown, and Asian people?  Will they go door to door and I will have to prove I am a citizen even though I was born here and my parents were born here.

Will the hit the brown Cubans in Miami who supported tRump, really doubt it."
"You want inflation?  Because this is how you get inflation

Agriculture and meat packing and construction are HUGE employers of illegals, because they work hard, they work cheap, and they don't dare complain

Also, they're doing the work Americans won't.  I mean, when's the last time you heard an American complain that an illegal took their job handpicking strawberries"
"Pay attention to Paul's REPUBLIC Act which has been somehow making its way slowly through the Senate. It would put a limit on Presidential ability to declare a national emergency without Congressional approval. Initially it came about targetting Biden but the GOP in the Senate might use it to reel in Trump's mas deportation plan. The GOP wants power and wealth and they used immigration to get that and wont get rid of the cheap labor and doom the economy by ""solving"" immigration. If so they lose any leverage to gain or maintain power in the future."
For those of you who don't understand our whole economy is basically built on illegal labor so get ready for prices to go up and the market to crash
As Hitler did with the Jews.. someone needs to take the blame for all the problems in the country
"The stock market should take more of a tumble each time he opens his big, dumb and nasty mouth.. Signalling a state of emergency appears to be his attempt to soften up Congress for his horror show cabinet picks. Do what I say or I will flex my emergency powers. Disobey me and I will step it up with martial law. 

Capital will flee from this madness before he is inaugurated."
Under Trump the USA will implode….  Unthinkable 8 years ago and now terrifying reality…..
Yay! Military on my street ripping crying children from their homes! All because you wanted to pay $2 less for eggs… it’s unreal.
I don't see how this won't blow up in their faces.  People ignorantly think all these immigrants are harming the economy and the US.  When businesses can't keep meat of the shelves and prices soar due to lack of labor people will be furious.  Fresh fruits and vegetables have the same issue.  When housing prices soar due to lack of labor to build new the housing market will only worsen.  Basically name any industry where the US labor uses immigrants somewhere will quickly become issues.  Then you have the tariffs and terrible cabinet management.  Flooding the market with debt money like he did the first term isn't sustainable.
"Declaring a national emergency allows the army to operate within the borders  . Most countries worry about the army returning to their original mandate after the emergency is quelled . Army in the streets special court-martial groups. Remember these times

"That is going be gloriously bad.  Declaring national emergency is to remove peoples rights like Miranda and the need for search warrants.

Then you have 60% of the American population who doesn't trust the government and one of the highest density of guns on the planet.  A military convoy rolling into a low economic area is going to create a hailstorm of bullets.  But the illegal immigrants won't have guns.  Do you think that the criminals in that area will care if the military is trying to stop them or the immigrants? No, they will defend themselves. Innocents will be killed in the crossfire.  There is a reason why the military try to avoid urban conflict."
"Do you want concentration camps?  
Because that’s how you get concentration camps."
People will get what they voted for
"I'd wonder how they plan to replace the farm workers they'll be deporting, but RFK is already discussing ""work camps"" for people who are ""drug addicts"" or who are ""mentally ill"" because, apparently, forced labor and being confined to a camp is supposed to heal mental illness.

(Cynically, I'm wondering how long until they declare being queer or a liberal to be a form of mental illness...)"
"Dear USA, Trump is your national emergency. Govern yourselves accordingly."
"F for the service industry, farms, construction. Rich people gonna have to clean their own houses too and mow the lawn"

""No camps and family deportations""

All this is going to be the case, and people fully know that and they still have voted for him."
lmao good luck fighting the lobbying by companies who rely on undocumented labor- they'll deport like a small fraction of the undocumented population just to look like they're doing something while the rest get extorted even more because said companies will use this deportation shindig as a massive stick to keep them in line

This is going to hurt people on both sides and maybe if they hurt their own people enough the next election will be different... if we have another one. I'm a middle aged white male that's lived here all my life, I'm not going to be personally effected by this much. I voted blue because many of my fellow Americans WILL be hurt by this kind of thing.

I’m not usually one to be a sensationalist… but things seem pretty fucked. I hope blue states do their best to resist… I don’t want us to reach the “normalization” phase. 
  
And just on this topic, mass deportation will wreck our economy, on top of making us look like monsters. Can’t believe this shit."

Ya all wanted dictator on day 1. I didn’t sign up for that shit. Hope you get what you want. There’s zero chance this fixes prices like eggs and gas but okay ya all wanna pay more?
Don't worry those egg prices will go down once all the farm labor is forced to work for free from prison before your tax dollars are used to purchase the pentobarbital that will eventually be used to execute the immigrants who resist or can't work.
Is anyone else feeling really furious about being forced to pay for the 4th Reich with their taxes?
"This was handled poorly during his first term and will be handled even worse now. Families will be forever changed and separated, the economy will be heavily damaged, and tax payer money will be wasted. 

It's going to be a mess and I don't believe they even have the manpower to handle it all. They'll probably hire contractors who really don't care about what happens to the people who are just trying to make a living.

Republicans will find a way to blame Biden and the Dems so don't expect his followers to feel bad about their decisions because they are fed a constant stream of lies."
"Watched Homan on a Hannity interview.  Hannity asked, 'Will you deport citizens?'.    Homan laughed and did not say no.  He guffawed then said ""We'll start with the illegals and criminals."", then never said No to the original prompt.  

My mom is a naturalized citizen since the 1970's, she has no connections back in her home country.  If they try ANYTHING, well... i'm going to buy a gun today.   Now if the military comes then yeah probably pretty stupid to shoot.  But if some Trump Gestapo, or larping militia come around... they can eat lead."
"Besides this leading to concentration camp level of dictatorship, according to the American Immigration Association this plan will likely cost a conservative estimate of [$315 billion](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/mass-deportation#:~:text=one%2Dtime%20mass%20deportation%20operation%20aimed%20at%20both%20those%20populations%E2%80%94an%20estimated%20total%20of%20is%20at%20least%20%24315%20billion)



>“In total, we find that the cost of a one-time mass deportation operation aimed at both those populations—an estimated total of is at least $315 billion. We wish to emphasize that this figure is a highly conservative estimate. It does not take into account the long-term costs of a sustained mass deportation operation or the incalculable additional costs necessary to acquire the institutional capacity to remove over 13 million people in a short period of time—incalculable because there is simply no reality in which such a singular operation is possible. For one thing, there would be no way to accomplish this mission without mass detention as an interim step. To put the scale of detaining over 13 million undocumented immigrants into context, the entire U.S. prison and jail population in 2022, comprising every person held in local, county, state, and federal prisons and jails, was 1.9 million people.”

This plan is infeasible and will damage our economy more and will lead us further to a fascist country."

Nice. I hope the ethics report still comes out. Leak it. Fuck the norms.
He must REALLY not want us to know what's in that House ethics report.
"He found out he would be working with JD Vance, not at a JV Dance."
2nd report saying there was another sexual assault case with a minor. Every single Republican who defended him are fucking sick weirdos
He just wanted that ethics report squashed.
His nomination got too old
"He withdrew 45 minutes after CNN called him to let him know they'd be reporting on a second sexual encounter he had with an underage girl in 2017.

[https://x.com/PaulaReidCNN/status/1859651549993238811](https://x.com/PaulaReidCNN/status/1859651549993238811)

EDIT: Not that this should matter, but some people think this is another girl and have asked for clarification. This is the same girl that he was accused of meeting with once before these news broke."
It's a start but I fear whoever replaces him as the nominee will be terrible as well.
"GOOD. He never should have been nominated in the first place. 

He quit Congress too so tf is he going to be now? a Fox news talking head?"
Now Ghislaine Maxwell can be nominated for AG.
He didn't realize Venmo could be traced?
"So, *NOW*, he’ll be charged and prosecuted using evidence from the Ethics Report as a private citizen, right?"
Pathetic to see the Twitter cult defending a kid fucker.
"While this is good news, the next AG pick will be equally as bad in effect. By originally nominating Gaetz of all people to be the fucking AG of all things, it shows trump's intentions and contempt for the department. Quash legitimate investigations, launch investigations against political opponents and members of the press, fire prosecutors, let Russian espionage agents run around freely within the US.

The Golden Age of Corruption begins on Jan. 20, 2025."
Fine. Now pursue criminal charges for sex trafficking a minor
"100% he made a deal. Withdraw and the report is not released. I guarantee that's what happened. 

Now just get someone to leak the damn thing."
MGT’s threat/call to expose everyone clearly worked…
Release the report!
"Good.

Release the ethics reports. All of them. Stop sheltering sex offenders."
"I called this 6 days ago.

He resigned immediately, which avoided responsibility via the report due - Trump did Chocula a favor and nominated him to make an excuse - he then had a made up reason to resign.

And now he withdrew.

TOTAL BULLSHIT.

This is Republican BS - a Republican \*Representative child predator GOT AWAY WITH IT.  Thanks to Donald Trump.

This is the real, disgusting, criminal Republican Party on full display.  

Guy should get arrested and then we can see him walk free of the police and justice system too because Republicans don't really care AT ALL."
"Now he can get back to his true passion, venmoing money to young women for absolutely no reason."
The report just be so fucking bad that he is scared it’s going to leak and be in jail before he can get confirmed
"This was the plan all along, wasn't it? The report on him was set to be released in two days when he was nominated and resigned from the House. This forced the report to be dropped before its release. His appointment also drew attention away from other dangerous appointments like Gabbard, Hegseth, RFK Jr.

If there's one thing that's consistent about Trump, it's long been his use of controversy to draw attention from controversy."
" I'm worried that Gaetz was used a scapegoat to anchor the AG pick **so badly** that whoever Trump nominates next, even though they will objectively be awful, will still seem better than Gaetz."
"He had to drop out because the number of days since his nomination was quickly approaching 18.

-- [MeidasTouch](https://bsky.app/profile/meidastouch.bsky.social/post/3lbhz2vva3c23)"
Release the report anyway cause fuck him
He is now a private citizen just go ahead with the prosecution. He has no friends anymore in high places.
How many Scaramuccis is that?
No fucking way!
"I'd celebrate there being one less pedophile in the government, but the GOP will just replace him with another pedophile."
"[I guess also openly bragging about your sexual conquests to your colleagues', complete with video evidence wasn't the power move you thought it was, hey Matt.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/04/01/politics/matt-gaetz-photos-women)"
"All part of a plan. Gaetz won’t be prosecuted for being a fucking chomo. Trumpists told him to resign from Congress so the ethics report couldn’t be used as evidence.

This is so typical for morally bankrupt and the corrupted Trump cult. "
"This is great news, but I'm scared to see who's next on deck. Part of me wants to think ""well, Trump's next pick can't be any worse than Gaetz"", but we all know that yes. Yes it can be."
And he quit Congress. Hopefully this fuck fades into obscurity.
Only good thing to come out of this is he's no longer a member of Congress
He clearly used all this to silence the ethics report.
Dems should be savages and still release the report
"Lol,


Oh look, the party of "" If you have nothing to hide who cares""

Guilty fucker"
Better carry that to term!
How many Scaramuccis did he last
"Man, they’re really afraid of that report, aren’t they?"
"In under 3 weeks, not only do we already have a Trump scandal, it’s already over. 

This is going to be a very very long 4 years."
His withdrawal shouldn't overshadow the fact that Trump tried to nominate a pedophile for attorney general
One child predator down 14505 to go
"So - now that we have an ethics report where he's clearly committed crimes..

He should be CHARGED WITH THOSE CRIMES."
So we all think that it’s bad enough that he should go to jail right?
Kyle Rittenhouse is gonna be watching his phone.
Not even inaugurated yet and there's the first domino to fall. Let's see if Pete Hegseth is next. Trump's second term is going to be a shitshow with huge turnover it'll have.
I'm sure Trump has another child rapist in the wings ready to nominate.
I'll bet those on the Ethics Committee said they would release the report if he didn't step down.  Some Republiklans were against Gaetz being given that position since he's a child molester.
Not even a fraction of a scaramucci
We're still two months away from his presidency and it's already a shit show.
">Matt Gaetz said Thursday he is withdrawing as President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. attorney general, ending the controversial bid that put prior allegations of sexual misconduct in the spotlight.

""Allegations of sexual misconduct"" Is a huge understatement."
"lmao. amazing.  

To anyone who was too young during Trump’s first term to remember: this is what it is like ALL THE TIME. He can’t keep anyone. He went through like 3+ secretaries of state, and chiefs of staff? Even more than that. One guy lasted like 11 days.  

The reasons for the rapid cycling are actually not uniform. Some people were idiot failsons and were never going to last anyway. Some are garden variety republicans who just got chewed up by Trump world. And on and on."
as always every republican accusation is a confession
Is he withdrawing from the AG nomination or yet another minor?
"That's some very good news. That being said, whoever replaces him could be worse."
Him withdrawing is even MORE reason to let us know what's going on. And MTG needs to be brought in for questioning regarding her statement.
"Trump hires only the best people, right?"
He should have said that to the teen girls he was sleeping with
"So happy to be wrong about this one. I genuinely thought he would pass with furrowed brows and lectures about lessons from Senators. 


Good riddance, Butthead."
Now the challenge for the team is to see if we can nominate someone even worse.
I wonder if the report would not only harm Gaetz but bring other Republicans into question during confirmation hearing. Madison Cawthorn’s comments still ring out along side Markwayne Mullin’s. 
"That ethics report and court hack must've been *really* damning. These are the types who've always pounded the table, doubled down, and never retreated."
"While it is ridiculous that his name was ever put forward to begin with and his withdrawal is clearly to get away from the ethics report, him not being considered any more for AG is good news."
"Release the report, sunshine is important."
Wow. Trump is so weak he can't even get the AG he wants lol!
"Trump now has become so bad at keeping his staff, that he loses them, before officially hiring them.

Must be a speed run category"
Do Trump next.
"I paid for that ethics report, I want it released.

Also, launch an investigation into why Mean Toe Greene is protecting the child rapist by threatening other hidden rapists with blackmail."
FOX News here he comes.
I'm willing to bet that he was pressured to drop out by all the people that Marjorie was threatening to expose and all the oligarchs along with it.
"That report needs to be released, regardless. He has already resigned to keep the ethics investigation from moving forward. To me, this all screams that there's something that the public needs to know about. And yes, I realize that these are concerns that have been brought up for years now.

I'm not saying they should, but there are plenty of people with access to that information, which could just be accidentally leaked. Just sayin..."
"It seems like [Scott Pinsker nailed it when he speculated that Gaetz was Trumps “big bag of blood” candidate.](https://pjmedia.com/scott-pinsker/2024/11/14/is-matt-gaetz-a-sacrificial-lamb-andor-our-big-bag-of-blood-n4934273)

Gaetz’s nom was a big head fake to allow him to exit Congress before the report was released, repaying loyalty, while triggering the left knowing they would raise hell. Then, as planned, Gaetz withdraws and Pam Bondi is nominated.  Anyone following Gaetz will seem relatively acceptable in comparison."
That ethics investigation must have been one hell of a report
The position must be too old for him now.
“Withdrawing” is not the same as “pulling out”.
Where are leaks when we need them?
The norms have been ignored by Republicans and treated as chains for the Democrats.
"This whole BS about norms drives me nuts. There have been numerous times over the years that ethics reports have been released after someone has left office, even a few that have started after they left office. This is just more gaslighting from the Republicans on what they don't want to happen."
"All of them, even the ones mtg is holding onto."
Amen brotha.
Well he can come back next congress because he was reelected. So they could just release it Jan 3 if they want
Pretty upsetting to know that we’re being governed by a bunch of sex predators and can’t really do anything about it
It should still come out.
"His buddy spilled the beans a while back and we have a pretty good idea about what he did. Transported at least one, maybe two underage girls across state lines. Put them in a hotel room. Gave them illegal narcotics. Had solo and group sex with them. Made Venmo payments with public comments. "
"He found out he would working for JD Vance, not at a JV dance."
"No, it’s the other republicans that don’t want MTG to get the word out on them"
"He's no longer a sitting congressman, the FBI will be way more likely to reopen the child sex trafficking case they bounced on the flimsiest of excuses."
Any member of the House Who has possession of that report has a duty to read it into the record from the house floor.
I don’t understand what’s the point to even having ethics report when there are things on the report that can end someone’s career and it still doesn’t get released.
Too bad Matt Gates couldn't stand up to even a Hunter Biden level of scrutiny. Even more sad Hunter Biden wasn't even in office for anything and he experienced more scrutiny on his personal doings. They always say if you've got nothing to hide then you have nothing to worry about but apparently Matt Gates wants to keep hiding everything. Hunter Biden has more transparency in his affairs than any Republican lately.

I guess this year at dinner I'll get to say I'm thankful that my family is intelligent and empathetic enough to vote for anyone but Trump. 
"My mom & dad both love Trump. My brother & I are the Trump haters. We finally decided to confront them this year and let them know how their unwavering support of a racist rapist for 8 years has made us feel. They were very patient and listened to us intently. They expressed regret for never considering our feelings before.

Just kidding, they blew up at us and cancelled the Holidays."
"Sadly, I was thinking of visiting my dad in Texas this Christmas, but my brother has gone full MAGA since moving there in 2020. 

I thought he’d be happy trump got elected, instead I had 5 days of endless texts of hate until I finally blocked him."
"I saw a reel the other day that sort of articulated what many on the left are feeling. When these people call for 'unity' and 'keeping the peace,' what they actually mean is conformity and submission to their worldview. In their opinion, their 'side' won, so back into the kitchen and closets the rest of us go. 

Except it doesn't work like that unless we let them. I won't sit down and keep polite. What they want is inherently wrong, immoral even."
I know I do not enjoy being in the company of people who hate me to the point that they will vote for a man who promises to use the United States military to deal with me.
About to watch all those Americans who said prices were high enough to warrant electing Trump go spend all their money on bullshit for Christmas.
I'm staying at home with the dog on Thanksgiving for the first time in 30 years instead of spending it with my moms family in the rgv. Gonna cook us some nice steaks for Thanksgiving.
"My grandpa has cancer again. My family was planning on flying in from all over the country to see him, but I don't think we will. He's totally a MAGA hat. While I love him a lot, I am in the closet around him, and none of his kids want to talk to him for more than a few minutes in person. Before Trump, he was a very interesting man with lots of lovely knowledge. Now, all he talks about is such awful things.

Concerning the article, I do hope she divorces him. I understand that Reddit is all about divorce, but I feel like this is just such a sad way to live. He'll never understand why people hated that he voted for Trump - and I don't think living your one life with a person who clashes so much with your ideas is a good way to go through things."
"I think it's reasonable. I'd stick with a simple, quiet explanation. If she calls you dramatic, just go with a very level, ""I'm sorry. I can't see you the same way any more.""

FWIW, I also think your relatives are showing their hands. If they genuinely thought the economy was in such a critical place and Trump was so instrumental to turning it around that they had to face the grim reality of sacrificing the rights and safety of fellow citizens as the lesser of two very bad options, they would not be laughing and mocking the people who will suffer. They wanted that outcome."
"Wednesday morning of last week my wife said that she doesn't know if she'll ever want to see my family again because voting for Trump is a direct attack on her freedoms. I totally get this sentiment even if people think it's hyperbolic. 

I saw so many people who I assumed were Trump supporters or openly Trump supporters posting shit like ""We can still be friends despite our political differences <3 :)"". No, saying women should die because you made abortion illegal isn't a political difference. How do they not get this?"
"Trump’s policies are so polarizing, his behavior is so disgusting, that we all know it ended relationships and marriages during his first presidency. And most likely it will happen again. 

The problem isn’t just that one spouse or one partner votes for one party and the other votes for another. Fundamentally, the policies, the attitudes, the stance on climate change, human rights, criminal accountability, women’s autonomy, are so diametrically opposed, it is hard to find any common ground, if any.  

It’s not just opposing views, it is the silo of views. The media machines have churned out polar opposite views on everything, making it next to impossible to have a healthy conversation. 

There’s also the reality on the ground that in 2024, women are dying, because they’re being denied emergency care for reproductive health. One side does not see a problem with that and one side does. These are very serious issues that are hard to get past."
"Yup.  Can't imagine celebrating while being among people who proudly voted for a felon, rapist, and traitor.

Edit:  Though this year, I am probably done with being polite.  They seem to like it when people tell it like it is, so if you tell me you voted for Trump, I'm happy to tell you that you're a fucking idiot.  ""Hey, nice Nativity scene.  You realize you voted for the guy who would have deported Joseph and Mary, right?"""
Aren't they going after no fault divorce as well? I would get that underway before the admin gets in. You can always live with him afterwards but at least you have freedom to leave.
"My extremely MAGA family who lives in rural bucks county asked me what dates I’d be home for Christmas this year. I told them I wasn’t coming. The last time I went back there I got harassed by strangers for having Massachusetts plates. The ignorant bunch just associate me with liberal politics and not as a human being. I can only imagine it’s going to be far worse this time around, and quite frankly, I’d rather be alone than around a dinner table where everyone is praising a psychopath who brainwashed enough Americans into becoming president. 

Not to mention they voted against my rights. As a gay person, I’m extremely concerned about the rhetoric and enablement that homophobes, and other bigoted minds are going to get out of this administration. I don’t really feel safe anymore."
"If my spouse had voted for trump I would be questioning her core beliefs.  

This isn't about politics, it's about character.  

If she could have voted for a person with the character of donald trump that would make me question her character."
"If politics were only about where to budget tax money and deficits and stuff, there wouldn't be any issue coexisting at Thanksgiving. But we are talking human rights and the future of democracy here!"
I unironically had a “Friendsgiving” cancelled because the host didn’t think people would be able to get along and be around each other because a couple in the group voted for Trump.
"I'm starting to distance myself from talking any politics at all. I know I can't change their minds on anything, and honestly I'm worried that things I say now will be used against me in the future.

Welcome to America."
It hurts my feelings more than I can say that my parents voted for things that will hurt my children. They are very elderly and frail and need their children’s help and we don’t feel like giving it. It’s so very sad.
How many of you purged friends and family after the election results? I know I did.
"Republicans don't understand humanity. 

You didn't win cultural dominance. You didn't win freedom from consequences. You didn't even win authoritarianism. You won a happy fee-fee on election night. 

Your family will not suddenly transform into a fictional 1950's tv show. You won't suddenly be promoted to the c-suite at work. Your win was shallow and short-term. Now you reap the consequences."
"Same. Wife is furious she will lose her student loan public service forgiveness (if the dept of education gets gutted)and Im about to lose my health insurance (if the ada gets gutted). Its infuriating that we are about to get booted out of the middle class and she doesnt want to spend time with people that celebrate that. And since every single member of her family (minus her mom) are truck nut maga hat loud supporters, they can go enjoy things with each other."
"Speaking of Thanksgiving, I've worked at a Tyson plant before (Tyson Turkeys). It's pretty ironic as to whom works those plants. Immigrants!!!! Full of them."
Family thinks I'm a traitor. They could be a danger to me. All of them cult members. No more contact.
I already did this following the 2020 election. My mental health has thanked me for it. No more annoying conversations that get spun into a political gaslighting argument.
"To anyone reading this who does not support Trump and resonates with this article, don't let the people posting here make you feel like you're the bad person. You have a right to feel the way you do. There's a lot of gaslighting MAGAs/pod people in this thread. Stick to your convictions and know there are many out there feeling outrage and utter disappointment in their friends and family who voted for him."
"Honestly, I knew I was already very privileged to have a family without divorced parents, but now I realize I have a unicorn family - we like each other, want to spend time with each other, and not one treasonous dumb fuck in the bunch."
"I’m thankful that I already cut out all my toxic family members. I’m doing Thanksgiving and Christmas, but it’s just me, my husband and son. I’m actually looking forward to it.

My husband didn’t vote for Trump. I don’t think I could stay married to him if he did."
"This is like leaving an abusive relationship on a national level.  He said he's ""changed"", he doesn't ""really mean the things that come out of his mouth"" etc. 

We're going right back into the abusive relationship. Sigh"
"""Friendsgiving"" is about to be huge in the next few years..."
"I'm torn between ""Don't talk politics with your family"" and ""If you wondered what normal people did when the Nazis rose to power, look at yourself and those around you.""

My family knows where I stand.  One of them hates going to my house because they have to walk by a pride flag to get in.  He tried to make fun of me calling me ""gay"" (I'm straight).  I told him I frankly don't care what he may think my sexuality is.

We live in a country where people love their sky-gods based on faith, but hate the people that clearly exist right here in front of them.  Then there's a group of people that simply couldn't be bothered to show up and vote because of apathy.  Shame on both of those groups.

I've got a feeling I won't recognize this country four years from now."
"I’m going to keep saying it. We can have different opinions on politics. It’s the fact that we now live in a world where sexual assault, felonies, blatant racism, blatant homophobia are all non deal breakers for so many Americans. These are moral values not political views. All sexual assault victims and survivors now have to live with the fact that their predators can become the president."
"This was inevitable. 

For the past decade MAGA have destroyed every norm and convention in US society, but enjoyed the positives because everyone else just accepted it. The perfect example is “Trump lose = Rigged election” but “Trump win = Fair election.” They wanted to have their cake and eat it too. 

Now everyone else have finally dropped the decorum and are prioritising their own peace. It’s finally affecting the day to day life of MAGA, and they don’t like it."
Idk if this is the place to put it but for anyone who doesn’t feel safe or welcome over the holidays we’re putting together an online Thanksgiving on discord for anyone interested.
"> I know he is a good man and he would do anything for a family member or friend

Literally voted to take your cousins rights away btw, so maybe not *anything*, eh?"
Trump is just the end game for a process that has been going on for almost 50 years. A process that has been repeated time and time again for 4000 years of history. Once the ultra rich band together to grab power through racism and xenophobia it's almost never been stopped.
I would probably break up with my partner if she voted for Trump. It would be difficult to stay with someone when you lose all respect for that person who voted to fuck over both our lives.
I’ve canceled every single one of my Trump relatives.  We usually have a whole family Thanksgiving gathering but we are done with that for the rest of our lives.
Every single person that voted for that man is an enemy of democracy. I would rather spend the holiday alone than pretend their insanity is excusable.
Good. Cut the fascists out of everything like a cancer
Well Trump voters have made it clear that they hate us for the past 10 years. Why should we entertain them when we could be doing something healthy?
"My brother concern trolled me about Trump when he visited my home a few months ago. He’s a doctor, and that’s important because my wife is immune compromised. She requires monthly infusions of antibodies to not suffer life threatening infections. I made it clear to my brother than Trump’s admin would cut my health insurance. I mentioned it was even likely I’d have to move overseas just to afford healthcare. 

My. Doctor. Brother. Laughed. 

He sent me a “MAGA” Wednesday. I told him that I was done with him. Trolling me while stabbing me in the back and finding it *funny* is a bridge too far.

You can’t choose relatives. I can choose those I have around me. My brother whined to my dad, who pressured me to relent, but F that. He made a choice. He can live with it.

Same goes for my friends."
"I've heard people respond to reactions like this like, ""how could you cut off family because of who they voted for"" and really it comes down to it's not because of WHO they voted for it's WHAT they voted for.."
Divorce him while you still can.
We disinvited my sister in laws family that were gleeful cheering in group about mass deportations.  They are both Coptic Arabs both first generation.  One with shakey legal status.
"More power to her, I could never stay married to a Trumper."
Looks like MAGA's gonna have to visit each other for the holidays. Too bad they all can't stand one another
"A Latino voted for Trump.  Wow.  What a surprise that is.   Macho males?  Latino on latino hate?    I don't know a lot about the culture.  I do get that there is a whole male macho, ""I'm not gay"", ""libs are gay"" mindset (from black, brown and white males).    I'm male and don't want to have anything to do with those males.  ( I would say I don't want to have anything to do with those men, but I refuse to call them men.)"
This is why I believe we must continually and consciously maintain our inner circles. Blood is meaningless if one fundamentally opposes some family members' humanity.
Incredible how this one man has done more damage and division in this country than any war could’ve.
"To the folks criticizing OP for breaking up with family over “politics” or “difference of opinion”, you are really missing the mark here. This is a difference of morality and values. And when people have wildly opposing moral viewpoints and values, it makes perfect sense that they wouldn’t hang out.  

Trumpers should not be shocked at this reaction. What in the world did they expect? "
Maybe divorce the husband as well while no fault divorces still exist.
"Your husband and family were swindled, but they have the next 4 years to learn they fucked up bad."
"Her having to figure out HOW to say something so as to not trigger his ego and subsequent shut down. Damn, men be oppressing women's feelings by HARNESSING fragile masculinity."
"Years ago, way back in 2021 i could tell they were going to villianize liberals. It has been the cornerstone of their rhetoric for 20 years.

I guess I had faith that smarter people were in the room."
"It's sad that she has no idea that her marriage is over.  
You can love someone and have been through 'too much'  
but the flagrant display of ...all that... will eat her soul.  
The next article will be about her mid-life divorce from her self-centered, but performative husband and how much it hurts that she never knew him at all."
My (F) wife's (..F..) all votes for Trump. They are educated people. They have great careers. The only reason they can give is Gaza and Economy and literally nothing has made them question him. My SIL openly admits she hates Trump but Gaza and Economy..🤮 I'm so fucking enraged. They keep insisting all the generic lies like he's not going to really do X Y Z. Thank God we don't have to do Thanksgiving or anything with them this year.
"I would cancel the marriage tbh. Wouldn't even need time to think about it. 

I don't want this maga bs in my life."
"""Still, I know he is a good man and he would do anything for a family member or friend""

Well, not anything."
We all need to do this. I have already arranged for Thanksgiving and Christmas with real Americans. Traitors can feed themselves together while they celebrate violence against their neighbors Make jokes about who they’re going to keep as slaves
My whole immediate family voted for trump and the crazy thing is we’re Hispanics 🤦🏻‍♂️I don’t feel like I have a family anymore and don’t even wanna see them anymore
"Yep. Half my family’s pissed because we’re not sitting at the table with Nazis.

One day, when people ask how the US could go from Obama to Hitler so fast, it’s because we let it into our homes. Piece by piece Let the Nazis sit there at holidays…you’re family. You’re more important than politics.  The Nazis never felt that way though….."
"My bf’s family (not him) thinks I’m rejecting god and denying him like Judas because I don’t agree that Trump winning is good. Apparently Trump winning was gods protection. Prob skipping out Christmas. 

Oh and we’re Canadian not even American."
"I’d divorce my wife if she voted for Trump. You can’t be an intelligent caring person if you voted for this dude. There’s something missing, empathy, intelligence, common sense. Take your pick."
Great decision. These people need shunning.
I wouldn't care as much if they weren't the ones bring up politics constantly and looking for arguments all the time. I don't know any Trump supporters who can control themselves when it comes to biting their tongue and keeping the peace.
"Trump voters being upset that their actions have consequences is so funny to me, but that’s how we should be reaponding. If they won’t feel any political consequences, make them feel personal ones."
Good for you
"Idk why she should have to host them. It’s weird being near people who are fine with you dying in a manner we know how to prevent, but decide they should die anyway. "
I’m avoiding family gatherings this year. Just not up to it. Still disgusts me that my family members supported that rotten orange.
My asshole family loves Trump too which is why we haven’t had Thanksgiving or Christmas in almost a decade. Join the club.
"My parents complained about this country for 4 years. They’re too concerned about their image to admit they voted for Trump but said the democrats have turned this country into a socialist pit. Said Trump will fix everything, but still won’t admit they voted for Trump. I have never asked them either fwiw bc there is no need to.

3 days ago I was FaceTiming them w my daughter. I mentioned the election and just how I’m concerned about the ACA for them with Medicare and their social security. I admittedly said unfortunately everyone is going to get what they voted for. They essentially ignored everything I said except for that. Step mom got upset and when I asked what the problem was she started screaming so I hung up.

Now they have blamed me for ruining Christmas. Blamed my generation for everything that’s wrong with this country. Demand an apology for making THEM feel uncomfortable in my house even tho I told them I would not like to let the let politics get between us for the sake of our 6mo daughter. Then they doubled down on blaming everything on me. I’m in an interracial marriage and they claimed that bring up the election was wrong out of respect for my wife and in-laws. I'm curious where that respect was when they voted but we know the answer to that. They cannot believe how bad of a person I am for making them feel the way they do. Also claim that the issue with this country is my generation is allowed to talk but doesn’t want to let anyone else speak. So I can listen to them complain for 4 years but as soon as I bring up concerns with new policies it’s “how dare you bring up politics, we were never going to bring this up!” Then claimed I came to them with an agenda.

They literally will not speak to me until I apologize to them for THEM feeling uncomfortable about their decision to vote for Trump. It's literally my fault they are uncomfortable about voting for Trump. Make this make sense."
"I canceled a cruise paid for by my trump dad who I haven’t talked to in 15 years. He’d be there too with his holier than thou wife. Up until a week ago, I was going with my husband, but now I want nothing to do with him and her. 

My dad and the rest of the trumpy family had previously turned their back on me and his own brother because we’re liberal. I despise them all. He wanted to see me one last time on this cruise. No thank you, bye! I was just using him to go on a nice cruise, our first, but there would be too much drama.

Only my mom and my husband’s mom are reasonable. My husband’s family also drank the kool aid, so he cut them all out.

We’ll go on our own trip with no strings attached."
"My parent’s TV has the Fox logo literally burned into the corner of their TV screen. While my daughter watched PBS and Cocomelon the Fox logo was omnipresent. This is what it did to their brains. I lost them to Trump in 2016 and it has never been the same. 

I miss them."
I’m kinda like “f**k all these Trump supporting family members”. I already know all the stuff they say behind-closed-doors.
"So the writer is a liberal and her husband is a maga?

Girl, you let that leopard eat your face..."
"heck yeah! Do not cook, clean, and entertain for a bunch of people who want you to be ""property"" and a third class citizen. Also, get a divorce now before it's too late."
"I understand this may be hard for many of you. But would you willingly bend your morals to break bread with people who hate you? Your friends? Your significant other? Who conspire behind your back? Demonize those who matter to you?

They hurt not only you, but your children, and your children's children. Their hateful rhetoric and anti-science agenda has stolen from your future and that of your children. All that you hold dear and care for, they poison.

Do not let them lie and manipulate you into thinking their views are ""just politics.""  They have already shifted the narrative enough to where people believe hating gay people, denying scientific research and data, or removing women's rights are valid politician opinions.  They are not. Those are signs of a person's character and morals. The ship for ""We just have a difference of political opinion"" has sailed long ago, and it was their own doing.

If they want to be bitter, hateful lunatics, let them find out how loneliness is the price to pay for such behavior."
And I keep hearing how “It’s a matter of opinion.”  No.  An opinion is do you prefer soda or juice.  This is a matter of a/morality.
"Anecdotal, but there are a lot of divorce lawyers who’ve said they’ve received at least twice as many calls as normal in the week following the election. I’m curious to see what the numbers are in a few years, too."
Pretty sure they will take away a womans right to initiate a divorce soon.
"On a previous post someone told of their father, who had a black wife and lived in a blue city, who lied and told his wife he was voting for Harris when he actually voted Trump. I assume that could lead to a divorce if she found out."
"Well, people have about 3 months to get that ball rolling because project 2025 is going to do a way with no-fault divorce. Trump is admitting it's his platform now, so I really hope the women who need to GTFO get going NOW."
I broke off a relationship in 2016 when he first got elected. I’d imagine this year is worse because people know who they voted for this time around.
"But didn’t the Evangelicals say that behavior will be more righteous under Trump?

…wait… now I see what they meant by ‘no-fault’ divorce…

If God wanted people to be more righteous, he’d tell us how to be, directly word-for-word. Too bad he already tried that, and a majority of Evangelical dipshits would still cancel Jesus if he returned today. It’s why I don’t take the whole “it’s God’s Will” lecture so seriously.

Like, if it’ll be “God’s Will” when sinful and blasphemous communities to be destroyed, why are all the hurricanes and floods passing up California or New York? It’s almost as if they’re missing the parts of the U.S. that spreads hatred, blasphemy, greed…… hol up… I think I understand “God’s Will” now."
"I've been saying it for years; Trump is a permission slip for people to be their worst selves openly.

Sadly, I think the answer is that the country as a whole is much more misogynist and racist than I thought it could be."
"Yeah must be nice. Mine is 95% 24/7 fox trumpers. They always ask why I don't come around much anymore. Like ok even if you support the agenda it doesn't have to be 75% of the topic of conversation.

It's idolatry through and through."
"I am a 45-year-old white guy and I am incredibly lucky that both of my parents are still alive and not nazis.


Unfortunately every single one of my other biological relatives through their support behind this evil man. So they are more than dead to me."
You had me there. lol.
I can't have a social visit with my parents without it escalating to yelling because they want to spout off on whatever was on the Fox News chyron that day.  I'm the only child.  They were nothing but doting parents for my entire childhood and since about 2016 they've become miserable unbearable people to be around.
"The jealousy I felt reading your comment really hit me, until I got to the end. I feel you."
I hope you instead get to spend it with friends and loving people in your life. The chosen family is much better than the blood one tbh.
*Not gonna lie. You had me in the first half.*
Cult.
Had me in the first 3/4.
"Sounds like the budget for your and your bro’s xmas gift to each other just tripled! NICE!  IDKAY, but my brother gives me way better gifts than my parents ever did. 

This is 100% a  joke silver lining comment. I’m sorry your parents are assholes. My elderly mom is dating a MAGAt from her church even though she’s extremely liberal. I tried talking to her about and she said “I don’t care. I love him!” Thank the gods we don’t live in the state and I won’t have to deal with him over the holidays. Meanwhile, I pulled the trigger on getting a tubal ligation, which will happen as early as Thanksgiving week."
"Shit losers, even shittier winners."
Nothing will ever make them happy. They aren’t capable of joy. They run on fear and hate.

"Now that a majority expect higher prices, the tariffs don't even need to happen for companies to raise prices. "
Google Trends still shows people are asking who pays for tariffs weeks after the election.
And 1/3rd of Americans are complete morons
"Two-thirds of Americans think Donald Trump’s tariff plans will only add to rising costs if implemented, and many are planning purchases ahead of his inauguration anticipating higher prices, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian.

[Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has called tariffs the most “beautiful word in the dictionary”, yet about 69% of Americans think tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices, according to the poll.

The majority of Democrats (79%), independents (68%) and Republicans (59%) all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the US. Nearly the same percentage of respondents said that tariffs will have a significant effect on what they can afford.

[Read the full story](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/26/trump-tariffs-prices-harris-poll?referring_host=Reddit&utm_campaign=guardianacct)."
One third of Americans are unfathomably stupid.
"Yet according to that same poll, 53 percent of Americans agree with Trump's tariff plans. This is the American electorate in a nutshell."
I thought my “I told you so’s” would start in January but I’m already almost out and it’s not even thanksgiving yet.  I will have to do an emergency reorder.   Hope those are not subject to tariffs too!
I guess a third of Americans *still* don’t understand how tariffs work 🤷🏿‍♀️
This is what happens when people vote for the candidate that “hates the same people they hate”.
“Elections have consequences” - Barack Obama
"Quoting - Economists largely disagree with Trump’s argument that tariffs will mean a significant uptick in domestic manufacturing. Companies will likely simply pass increased costs onto customers.

Well. duh!  It's always the lowest on the ladder that pays the price."
The other third are in for a surprise!
"We voted for a guy that doesn’t find the best solution, he picks one, often suggested to him from somewhere else, and quadruples down on it regardless of how bad everything goes up in flames.  Buckle up and save up.

It’s Trump’s Razor: impossible to distinguish ineptitude from willful destruction of America."
"KNOW. Two-thirds of Americans KNOW it will. That's how tariffs work.

One-third of Americans get pissed on by Republicans and tell the rest of us it's raining."
The remaining third responded “what?” to the question.
"So it wasn't the price of eggs. Gee, wonder what the real reason(s) were. Hatred of people who don't look like them or act like them or think like them? Hatred of women? Because it apparently wasn't the price of eggs. Who could possibly have guessed?"
"And it's not just the cost of imported products that are going to rise. 


Tariffs will impact prices across the board, including those of domestic products. Very few items produced in America are made entirely independent of the global supply chain, from the raw materials to the machinery used in production. This means that the cost to produce domestic goods are likely to rise, leading to higher prices for consumers."
You voted for this!
"Instead of making Trump ""I did that"" stickers, they should be sticker mirrors that say ""I voted for this""."
"THEN WHY DID YOU CUCKS VOTE FOR HIM? Dear god, I feel like I’m taking crazy pills."
"Slapping a general tariff on all imports **is** going to raise prices. From items in groceries to car parts, it's impossible to escape."
"Of course it will. The American people voted. There was a primary process, and they voted to allow a convicted felon, the most corrupt political figure in American history to sit at the height of power and influence in the US and become president again. Character no longer matters, honesty no longer matters, rules of decorum no longer matter, his policies of vengeance, policies to protect and grow wealth for the wealthy, policies that will increase fear among marginalized communities,  empowering of hate and retribution.  The American people voted. This is what we wanted. I want to be hopeful. Let's pray for positive outcomes. I would love to be wrong."
Republicans (59%) all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the US. So even republicans believe in that.
BuT tRuMp wAs sTrOnGeR oN tHe eCoNoMiE
"This must mean a portion of the 2/3 voted for him, and many cited the economy as a reason for voting for the criminal. So wtf gives??"
"One candidate said they’d take on price gauging. Another candidate said they’d raise prices.  

The people said “things have been expensive these past 4 years, so we’re going to vote to make them even more expensive because of how expensive it’s been.”

MAGA math"
"I just want to say that it’s insane how much relatively reasonable back and forth conversation is going on in Conservative subs about tariffs, NOW, when there was hardly anything of the sort before the election. It’s almost like they’re part of a cult and someone has just handed them the kool aid."
"Welp. Time to buy up some trump ""I did that!"" stickets to paste... well everwhere i guess"
"People who vote Republican are dolts who believe anything.

Tariffs have been around for hundreds of years. They are a protectionist tool. They are used to protect important national products or industries from unfair foreign competition. They work by placing an artificial monetary penalty to the cost of a foreign  product and that is designed to cause consumers to choose to buy a same/similar domestic product because the price of the foreign product they might choose is now too high.

And Republicans (the progenitors of the free trade) have followers that are too stupid to read or understand the basics of how things work in the real world because they have been groomed to believe lies and magical thinking talking points."
"That’s weird. I saw a sign on the road today in rural NC that said “Trump low prices. Kamala high prices”

Was this sign lying?

/s"
I wish two-thirds of Americans had fucking voted that way. They just let fascists take over. They're just letting them do it. I can't fucking believe this entire god forsaken country.
I fully expect eggs prices to come down. If they don’t I’m going to be annoying maga 24/7 why the prices are still high. Even if it’s 4 years later.
"I encourage everyone to get ahead of this now in terms of the likely outcome of these tariffs because Fox and other legacy media will attempt to gaslight the public months from now when the economy goes to shit as a result of Trump's dog shit agenda. They will blame it on Biden, ""The Democrats"", millenials, liberals, lgbtq, whatever. They're going to run damage control for Trump and the GOP's incompetence by trying to gaslight the public into thinking the reason is anything but Trump and the GOP. We need to combat the media and do so preemptively. It's a bandaid on a gunshot wound, but it's better than nothing and perhaps we can reach some people by educating them and letting them know what the reason will be when they go to Walmart or Lowes and the cost of goods is inflated. Mark my words, FOX will do everything they can to convince Republican voters that this isn't Trump's fault. We can't let them do that. We need to fight back and do it now. Plant the seeds."
This is how much they’ve been taught to hate Democrats.
"Here's the thing - the ones who know and still voted for Trump, do not care. The ones I've spoken to are fully convinced that whatever Elon said about times getting hard, is a prophecy and needed. They know and still seem to think it's a ""good"" thing....and these are very lower-middle class people. Same thing with health insurance."
Won’t matter. They’ll blame it on the Libs and the lemmings will believe them.
America voted for this so America can live with the results and consequences.  This is what an uninformed electorate can do to a country.
Hope all of the Midwest is ready for our gas prices to go up. We import most of our crude oil from Canada. So gas will go up by 25% if Trump gets his way.
Suddenly Biden’s “horrible” economy doesn’t look so bad
Last week Walmart came right out and said they would be raising prices due to the tariffs. Were 33% of America just not paying attention?
54% of American adults read below a sixth grade level
"The other 1/3 voted for him.

If only the 1/3 of Americans who are non-voters actually showed up."
"Correction: Two-thirds of Americans *know* Trump’s tariffs will lead to higher prices, poll says. 

If conservative voters took the time to learn literally *anything* they didn’t have to learn in school or for their jobs, they’d know all this already too."
"Maybe, hear me out, but mayyyybe the voters knew higher prices were part of the deal, and were willing to pay it for the hate and anger he promised he’d bring to those “others”. 🤷‍♀️"
"Because they will! Holy fuck are Americans who voted for Trump fucking stupid.

Trump doesn't even know how a tariff works, or if he does he knows it will only increase prices. I am so glad I am planning to leave this dogshit country."
"So if tariffs will raise domestic pricing, why is Trump proceeding with this? I would imagine he has some economist with him saying this is a bad idea, right?

No one in his circle thinks it’s a bad move?"
"Alternate headline 

“Two-thirds of Americans actually know what tariffs do unlike the President elect”"
Two-thirds of Americans KNOW Trump's tariffs will lead to higher prices.    Because WE know how tariffs work.
"They will.   And the other 1/3 are uneducated idiots.   It's also going to lead to shortages of things.   Don't worry though,  the rich will still be fine."
"And yet a bunch of them voted for him, to “lower the price of groceries”. 

Dumbasses."
The other 1/3 have been wearing their red hats so tight it's cut off circulation to their thinkers
"If you're someone who voted for Trump, honestly, fuck you. This collective nightmare that we are all going to experience is your fucking fault and I can't stand you"
"Remember when all those voters jumped to Trump election and said it was primarily the economy? lol 

Not the sharpest"
That’s what you get for voting for him. Stupid idiots. Brain dead people.
And yet they still voted for him. Idiots.
Yeah but they get to own the libs or something idk
"Well, maybe they shouldn't have fucking voted for him then? 

Seriously, I am so beyond giving a fuck about this shit. Massive tariffs on ALL imports has legitimately been the second most important plank in the dude's platform since he started campaigning in earnest again, right behind forcibly deporting tens of millions of people. 

Don't vote for the guy that's going to intentionally raise prices if you care about prices. If you do, then you deserve whatever you get IMO."
"So why did you fucking vote for him then?!?!?!?!? This wasn't new news, he was preaching tariffs on the election trail"
"Most US manufacturing companies that outsource parts/components/materials do so on contract terms.  For a tariff to drive the work back to the US, it would need to outlast the contracts.  It’s a better and cheaper bet to wait 4 years and assume the next admin will drop the tariff, while just passing on cost to consumer until then.  Once the tariff drops off, consumers will be used to the price, so companies will keep the price and reap profits from the tariff removal.  Moving more money to the top while convincing idiots he’s doing it for them.  People need to stop talking about Trump like he’s an idiot, he is in a lot of ways, but when it’s the personal gain and wealth accumulation for him and his?  He’s smart and pulling this one over on just enough people to make it happen.  World’s greatest grifter. And people fall for it."
The 1/3 have always been the problem.
"Well yeah, because that's how it'll work."
Because they’re right.
Then those 2/3 of Americans should have voted against him
"Anger over post-pandemic high prices has led to incumbent governments everywhere being removed from power, yet a decisive majority of Americans seem to understand that we have voted for policies that would further increase prices.  Make it make sense."
Oh no how can this be???  Trump is doing exactly what he said he was going to do. Oh my and the consumer is going to pay more for fruits and vegetables but what about the cost of eggs???  Well at least we owned the libs and we are going to show those trans people they have no bathroom rights.  S/
"Why invest in making American-made goods cheaper when you can just make everyone else's goods more expensive? It's not like the US government has any interest in investing in their own industries the way other countries do. That would be an example of Leadership, but they'd call it Communism."
1/3 are the losers who voted for Trump....
And their dumbasses voted for him anyway...
…and it’s cool because the libs were owned.
So do 100% of economic experts. Unfortunately our nation decided to vote for a guy who says experts are always wrong and he’s always right.
Where were these 2/3 this past election?
And yet they voted for him.  JFC
"There's going to be an inflection point at about 2 years in, between when the economic gains of Biden administration subside and the shit policies and market volatility of a Trump administration takes its toll.

We saw something similar with Trump's first term after Obama set the economy up for success."
They literally voted for this…
"Fucking duh you complete and utter idiots. 


He's not a black chick though so it's cool. "
So they voted him in part due to inflation under Biden whilst also acknowledging that Trump’s policies will increase inflation? Morons
2/3 are correct. The other 1/3 are idiots. Information at their fingertips and they don’t understand what a tariff is.
If only there was some way of knowing about this BEFORE voting for him
Many of these dipshits voted for it.
And yet the stupid elected him
"Only 2/3rds?

I mean, on its face, if you throw 20% tariffs on really anything, there’s going to be a price impact. Idk why you would think otherwise."
"Think?

Nah, we KNOW."
Can’t believe only 1/3 are stupid enough not to realize it.
"He's such an idiot.  China will step in for Canada and Mexico instantly.  He's basically giving the world economy to China.  What a moron.  Think unemployment was high during his first presidency, wait till the end of this one."
"Many of these people will also say, we think he is a nasty and pitty person, we don't agree with many remarks of his. But we will vote for him. Why? Oh, the egg price is so high, and I don't like WOKE talk on the media. Plus, Trump is so, so good at economy."
"So about 66% KNOW tariffs will increase prices.

Yet about 49% or so voted for it. 

Make it make sense!"
I’m guessing the third that don’t think so are the ones who voted for that idiot.
I’d like to take this opportunity to extend a warm “fuck you” to the 1/3 of Americas who decided not to vote in this last election. Thanks much assholes!
But 2/4 eligible voters voted for him? Something is not adding up.
Does anyone here think Republicans will own the TrumpTariffs™  once they do the damage? They’ll find someone else to blame when prices skyrocket
"This is one of the many reasons I was so disappointed by the American election.  While I was sad for Americans; I knew it would have a large impact on Canadians.

Your president elect is going to drag multiple other countries into a recession with you and you're gonna have a chunk of your population thank him for it while blaming everyone else."
It’s time print a bunch of “I did that” stickers with Trump on them to stick EVERYWHERE
"He took a machete to the economy in his first term, now he’s gonna drop an 80 gigaton thermonuclear warhead on it."
"It's hilarious watching the conservative sub get angry about this.

They know what's going to happen. They don't like it. But they'll still defend him."
AND YET 50% OF AMERICANS VOTED FOR HIM.
"And apparently a lot of those people DID NOT VOTE.

fuck them"
And the morons still voted for him
Well where the fuck were they on November 3rd??
"Two-thirds of Americans are more financially literate than I gave them credit for.

Too bad it wasn't enough to prevent Trump from retaking the White House."
