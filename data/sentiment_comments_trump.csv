"the world is not going to end

america as a democracy is slowly crumbling before our eyes but the world will go on

the good

 we democratically elected a president there was no violence although if the dems had won trump was certainly going to incite more violence historically speaking people get the elected leaders they deserve

the bad

 competent government there is no question that kamala would have presided over a competent federal government she had sound policies which btw were incredibly centrist that are supported by a majority of americans trump will install political hacks and sycophants in all levels of government how do i know check schedule f we are in for bureaucratic nightmares
 economy the us economy by all measures is the best of the developed world since covid by a long shot stock market indices are good inflation has cooled unemployment is at its lowest sustained levels in years manufacturing jobs roared back under biden so essentially biden took a shitty economy which btw was not all of trumps fault but he does share quite a bit of blame his taxation policies have continued the hollowing out of the middle class by transferring the tax burden from the super rich down to lower economic brackets and landed it perfectly with help from the federal reserve trumps policies will have some pretty negative longterm consequences for the us when they say tax cuts everyone making under  will see their taxes increase only those making over  will see a decrease in their taxes
 environment regulations designed to protect human health and welfare will be eroded when you get pancreatic cancer from pfoapfas i hope you buy a maga branded colostomy bag from team trump
 education they are going to continue to devalue education expect the quality of education in this country to decline
 health care we already have a health care system that is in shambles no western country pays more for health care and has worse outcomes if you really want to understand why i would highly suggest reading americas bitter pill by stephen brill

the ugly

 hate america embraced hate like it has never embraced hate before first election of trump yeah ill give you a pass for electing him but second go round you know exactly who you voted for and why dont kid yourself there have been white nationalist movements in this country going all the way back to the knownothings but maga is that on on jp it is cruelty to those that are the most vulnerable amongst us people of color immigrants the marginalized those people will lose the most a president that called large swaths of american citizens the enemy and turned americans against each other is now going to be there for the next four years
 constitutional government americans elected a president that has continually shown is willing to break the law and ignore the constitution the guardrails are off the adults that were in the room that recognized the importance of the constitution are gone all bets are off we have full monty trump and it is going to be dayafterday constitutional asswiping for the next four years he is who is is and he will do what he says is going to do he has also packed the court with ideologues that have skewed versions of the constitution and the limits of executive authority
 russia the biggest winner in all of this while maga was popping corks and dems were in tears nobody noticed that russia actively attacked our election they attacked in the leadup and they attacked it on election day this happened and really it should be the lead story it is also hugely problematic that twitter x is also being used as a propaganda tool for the russian government when musk had shortfalls to purchase he relied on outside investors including some middle eastern and russian to front the money with musks contacts with putin this is incredibly problematic i find it interesting that the maga crowd who is virulently anticommunist is okay with musks cozying up to communist and a presidential candidate that has had multiple offtherecord conversations with putin i am not saying that musk or trump committed treason but they are sailing perilously close to the fucking wind here

there is much more but this is the sad truth the national media is also to blame here but probably not for the reasons you think especially maga we live in a nation that has fully embraced fear and ignorance we will reap what we sow americans are asking the wrong questions do we want to live in a country in which the richest control access to the truth do we want an economy that destroys the middle class do we want to continue to degrade the environment",-0.9855,Negative

police were trained in paramilitary tactics used military grade weaponry and invaded neighborhoods nightly with no or sketchy warrants that ignored due process all they had to say is there is crack in that house all must be arrested or killed no questions asked while it has been greatly reduced the tactics are still used today and they are only eschewed when they get caught
