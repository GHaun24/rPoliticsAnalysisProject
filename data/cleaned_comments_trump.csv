"dem turnout

 million in 

this isnt a victory of rs they actually had  million less voters this year over  this is a colossal failure of democractic voters to actually show up to vote"
yep most of the people who voted for him will be negativity affected by his policies im an uppermiddle class white dude ill be just fine i voted for kamala cause im not a selfish asshole
interest rates will be slashed prices and housing costs will soar out of control wages will freeze wealth will flow upward at an ever greater rate until the whole thing comes to a halt because only the few are left with spending money just like the end of any monopoly game and the damage may not be fully felt until  years from now the presidents after may not be able to repair it all empires fall this could very well be chapter
wtfthe man lost the last election by  over  million votes and now after all he has said and done hes won the popular vote with most voting americans voting for him im in the backyard right now yelling what charleston heston yelled in the planet of the apes its a madhouse and now trump will tell the federal prosecutors something else charleston heston said get your stinking paws off me you damn dirty prosecutors

its going to be funny as hell watching all his supporters wonder why everything has substantially gone up in price"
"when someone tells you who they are believe them

america is a country where a majority of the voting population is perfectly happy putting a senile rapey racist convicted criminal and fraudster into the white house even after already experiencing  years of his lunacy this is just what america is full stop"
at this point we deserve it i had hope for america but after last night its clear the people want this so let us have it let the foundations we built crumble and true hardship set it maybe it will make the hardcore trumpers realize their mistake and  the undecideds regret their complacency
removed
this country deserves everything it gets for what its done
well good thing is democrats wont have to worry about voter turnout next time because there probably wont be a next time
probably im waiting for the public school system stuff to be overhauled when that starts happening you will see the results of this outcome
"sad to say but the electorate has bought their ticket and now they get to take the ride and deal with the consequences

turns out voting has effects"
i dont understand the guy completely botched his handling of a pandemic then convinced people vaccines and masks somehow infringed on their rights leading to more and more senseless deaths and he is somehow rewarded with another term oh and convinced people that somehow the experts on the matter were the bad guys how do people connect with this man
no this country will not regret a single thing they will cheer and applaud with grins on their faces as we all get lead to slaughter we deserve every bit of hell this fuck face is going to unleash
i just want to point out that this is from the hill this isnt from slate or commondreams the hill is centerright
i mainly feel sorry for all the people in palestine lebanon and ukraine who will face the consequences but couldnt vote but most of all i feel sorry for our habitat and future generations
america is over its people are rotten and it will take generations to filter out the filth if ever
"apparently  of the country needs a serious bracing reality check i hope trump does deport all these latinos families and drowns the middle class in taxes because of tariffs i hope all those gen xers protesting on college campuses who didnt want to vote for kamala because shes a genocider sleep well when they see whats in store for palestines future during trumps presidency

edit sorry gen zers its been a long night"
its not the decision i made and i regret it regardless
yeah we fucking know
im not going to be able to retire am i theyll look social security to save elon some taxes and ill die at my keyboard
so russia finally won the cold war with a knock out when america punched itself in the face
"i hope every middle to low income maga supporter gets exactly what is fucking coming to them higher prices thanks to tariffs no welfare no healthcare no help at all 

drown in fucking despair and poverty you fucking fools"
"as an american i already regret my countrys decision to elect trump 

we look like a bunch of gun loving racists misogynistic imbeciles"
this country is full of idiots who think theyre smart
"the world is not going to end

america as a democracy is slowly crumbling before our eyes but the world will go on

the good

 we democratically elected a president there was no violence although if the dems had won trump was certainly going to incite more violence historically speaking people get the elected leaders they deserve

the bad

 competent government there is no question that kamala would have presided over a competent federal government she had sound policies which btw were incredibly centrist that are supported by a majority of americans trump will install political hacks and sycophants in all levels of government how do i know check schedule f we are in for bureaucratic nightmares
 economy the us economy by all measures is the best of the developed world since covid by a long shot stock market indices are good inflation has cooled unemployment is at its lowest sustained levels in years manufacturing jobs roared back under biden so essentially biden took a shitty economy which btw was not all of trumps fault but he does share quite a bit of blame his taxation policies have continued the hollowing out of the middle class by transferring the tax burden from the super rich down to lower economic brackets and landed it perfectly with help from the federal reserve trumps policies will have some pretty negative longterm consequences for the us when they say tax cuts everyone making under  will see their taxes increase only those making over  will see a decrease in their taxes
 environment regulations designed to protect human health and welfare will be eroded when you get pancreatic cancer from pfoapfas i hope you buy a maga branded colostomy bag from team trump
 education they are going to continue to devalue education expect the quality of education in this country to decline
 health care we already have a health care system that is in shambles no western country pays more for health care and has worse outcomes if you really want to understand why i would highly suggest reading americas bitter pill by stephen brill

the ugly

 hate america embraced hate like it has never embraced hate before first election of trump yeah ill give you a pass for electing him but second go round you know exactly who you voted for and why dont kid yourself there have been white nationalist movements in this country going all the way back to the knownothings but maga is that on on jp it is cruelty to those that are the most vulnerable amongst us people of color immigrants the marginalized those people will lose the most a president that called large swaths of american citizens the enemy and turned americans against each other is now going to be there for the next four years
 constitutional government americans elected a president that has continually shown is willing to break the law and ignore the constitution the guardrails are off the adults that were in the room that recognized the importance of the constitution are gone all bets are off we have full monty trump and it is going to be dayafterday constitutional asswiping for the next four years he is who is is and he will do what he says is going to do he has also packed the court with ideologues that have skewed versions of the constitution and the limits of executive authority
 russia the biggest winner in all of this while maga was popping corks and dems were in tears nobody noticed that russia actively attacked our election they attacked in the leadup and they attacked it on election day this happened and really it should be the lead story it is also hugely problematic that twitter x is also being used as a propaganda tool for the russian government when musk had shortfalls to purchase he relied on outside investors including some middle eastern and russian to front the money with musks contacts with putin this is incredibly problematic i find it interesting that the maga crowd who is virulently anticommunist is okay with musks cozying up to communist and a presidential candidate that has had multiple offtherecord conversations with putin i am not saying that musk or trump committed treason but they are sailing perilously close to the fucking wind here

there is much more but this is the sad truth the national media is also to blame here but probably not for the reasons you think especially maga we live in a nation that has fully embraced fear and ignorance we will reap what we sow americans are asking the wrong questions do we want to live in a country in which the richest control access to the truth do we want an economy that destroys the middle class do we want to continue to degrade the environment"
"my father told me something when i turned  that always seems to ring true

never underestimate the stupidity of the american people"
i hope rfk ends up being too weird for trump in the end
"i cant wait for these trumpsters to meet the consequence of their own actions

i didnt know they were going to deport my familycoworkerfriend  
wait i was going to retire soon what do you mean social security is going to be exhausted years earlier than anticipated  
why didnt the government give us the information regarding the hurricane that just floodeddestroyed my house  
why is there a measles outbreak in my community  
i dont get it the economy is going great why are the electronic gifts i want to buy for my family not in stock at any of the stores  
why did the price of my groceries not go down i thought china is paying the tariffs   
its outrageous my daughter needs to visit a planned parenthood and the closest one is many states away  
the company i work for got a huge tax break so why did i just get let go  
we finally stopped giving billions to ukraine so why is the homeless issue in my city not solved yet  
why the fuck did elon musk just remove insert agency we really relied on their services"
yep the people of america have voted against themselves and didnt even realize it
most of the world will regret this decision
we deserve whatever happens to us if americans are that fucking ignorant bring the pain
removed
except in states like ca so mostly red state people unless the supreme court shenanigans us
exactly this i have lupus my one medication alone is  a month without it my body will kill itself its already trying to kill itself now with preexisting conditions potentially coming backi cant afford my meds to simply survive
ive been saying this a whole bunch of folks have no conception of what will happen when they gut the aca  most voters under  dont really even fully get what ramifications of this
my whole career circles around the aca and the ada  the ada has only been around since   legislatively its still in its teenage years  the aca is an infant  im going back to school because im going to be out of a career if eitheror get repealed  the nlrb is being challenged at scotus brought by amazon  microsoft and other oligarch companies to take away our right to dispute labor law violations and thats one step away from gutting osha and other protections  when hipaa gets demolished our employers will be able to choose not to hire us because they dont like whats in our medical records  i have mental health issues ive had an abortion etc  im also headed toward middle age  how long before as a woman im considered unemployable  my husband is disabled and on ssa  ill have to get a second job if his benefits are cut  he cant work or itll kill him  i want him to live so i wont have any choice but to kill myself for our survival  im so intimately familiar with how fucked were all going to be this as the dismantling begins  i tried my hardest to educate people on whats going to come for us  nobody believed  aside from reddit i am in a sea of red
the va uses aca to support its vets but vets voted against it good luck once its gone you know the republicans stance on disabled and veteran folk and you happen to be both
they wont want obamacare just the aca and yes theyre often too fucking stupid to know its the same thing
deleted
all the diabetics in the south going to be screwed
my wife and her sister have crohns their dad voted for trump poor thing was crying this morning because she is so scared of whats going to happen to her she didnt ask for crohns and shouldnt be fucked even more because of it its already expensive enough to be born with a preexisting condition
i have a son born with heart defects that have been surgically repaired but not forever he is a preexisting condition i also have a godmother who survived cancer twice shes gonna be really upset when her insurance drops her as too costly of a risk i will remind them that my son may not have coverage for the next surgery he needs i may not speak to them ever again
this absolutely terrifies me  anyone with medical issues in their family should be terrified  maybe even worse than preexisting conditions is lifetime caps on benefits  one good round of cancer could invalidate you for health care for the rest of your life  my only hope is that theyre so busy ratfucking the environment and the education system that they dont get around to this in time
just wait till jd vance creates two risk pools  one for younger people and one for older people suddenly youll have millions of people with completely unaffordable insurance at this point im done  if the leopard eats their face i dont care if they cut medicare  ill just smile at my inlaws and say thats really tough oh well
make america great depression again
slugs for salt
theyre going to need scapegoats and thats when its going to really get ugly
its your duty to remind them who they voted for when the time comes
its like texas blaming democrats even though the gop has been in power for decades
but it wont be his fault that is all he has to say and this election proves that
im in my s and i play fortnite because i use my time wisely one of my friends was talking about trump fixing the economy with tariffs i politely asked him what a tariff was and how it would fix inflation he got upset left the game blocked me immediately trump voters in a nutshell
deleted
have we tried jailing the reporters yet  maybe that will help
the correct response to this when talking to a trump voter is because of your vote never let them live this down
"second great depression 

one of the reasons we went through the great depression was because of high tariffs from the smoot hawley tariff act"
then the disastrous economic effects will be left for the next dem president to fix while still being blamed for it the poor bastard then the republican after that will reap the political benefit of the dems policies before dismantling them repeat ad nauseum
theyre going to strangle us
the only possible upside is he basically never does what he says he will do so maybe no tariffs
already made a vow only to purchase groceries for the next  years no luxury consumer products food mortgage insurance and thats it no phones tvs cars computers just basic life necessities probably a gun though
they will blame it on the democrats they are incapable of critical thinking
"yeah it doesnt matter

everything in their misery is because of democrats fault

everything in their gain is because of djt credit

its that simple and they wont change their ideas its a political environment we live in"
unfortunately the damage this will do will take decades to recover from
currently grading assignments where i asked students to justify their responses these college students dont have any idea what a cogent argument looks like its terrifying
"yep  theyll never regret what they seem incapable of remembering and connecting to current events  theyll accept whatever misdirected blame is spoonfed to them


they will get everything they deserve but unfortunately so will the rest of the planet"
i probably would feel less worse if i knew he lost the popular vote but my belief that most in this country are decent is gone i wont ever get that back now i know a majority is just evil and hateful
"theyll pay a whole lot more for everything face a recession kill countless women through abortion bans give away ukraine to a dictator

but hey they probably wont have tampons in mens bathrooms and trans athletes probably wont be able to compete in the us you know the really important issues"
i mean are we capable of reflection we clearly did not anticipate that trump would win in a landslide and that all of america would veer strongly right why did this happen
specifically the dnc  say what you will about the voters but the lost voters from  shows that having a candidate picked by the dnc and not the voters in a primary is ruining the democrats chances  and not just this election but  as well
just wait until they have to pay the tariffs of  on a lot of things
at the democrats theyll be upset at the democrats and immigrants and whoever trump tells them to blame
our best hope is that hes too tired to care he looked exhausted last night he cant run again and hes in his final years hes got nothing to play for hopefully hes mostly a lame duck this time ukraine is still fucked though and probably wont be on the map once his presidency is over and putin will have a decent hold on the us forever more
straight facts the critical thinkers are being out bred and this is the result
and a morality check failed that too

its okay because he wouldnt go after the family oriented illegals that wouldnt be fair
"when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time  maya angelou

no those other times that was okay because it didnt hurt me but this one might so clearly hes joking"
"ignoring the humanitarian issues here

most people said they voted based on the economy  economists suggest that if trump does in fact move forward with this plan it will effect the economy negatively more than tariffs

the theory is simple  many people with questionable status work in the food industry  processing meat and farming being two of the big ones  if these people arent there to do their jobs then the work doesnt get done or it gets done at a much higher cost  so youll see an immediate price increase on everything in the grocery store as a result

exactly what trump voters didnt want will absolutely happen under trump"
"youre overreacting hes not going to use the military on immigrants

youre overreacting hes using the military on immigrants but i dont think of them as humans so stop overreacting"
trump will create national emergency with results that include soaring prices for homes produce etc
suspending habeas corpus thats not terrifying at all
"the immigrant who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you you shall love the immigrant as yourself for you were immigrants in the land of egypt i am the lord your god cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner the fatherless or the widow

christian nation lol"
people voted for chaos and fascism that is what they will get thats democracy
"oh man its like hes absolutely going to do the thing we were fucking warning you about

edit this is more a statement towards the democrats that stayed home  i couldnt care less what the people who voted for him think"
itll cost billions to just deport them billions in lost tax revenue and millions in lost real estate earnings if you want a depression this is how you get one
we definitely have a national emergency and its definitely not the immigrants
inb his defenders say hes obvs just being sarcastic
people think groceries are expensive now  wait until the magic of tariffs and the overnight evaporation of cheap labor
"for many of you this is an existential threat for me its in my backyard i live in an immigrant heavy neighborhood in a large blue metro unfortunately in a purple state that went red our goober governor will do nothing to stand in trumps way im surrounded by dozens of low income apartment blocks that are chock full of thousands of migrants most of whom are here undocumented it is a well known thing and i dont see how if this happens that

 a a significant number of my neighbors just dont flee ive been watching people work like crazy in the last two weeks no doubt to save up cash in case they need to bug out or already plan to go before inauguration day 


b a significant portion of people have convinced themselves this is all talk and will not change a thingwhich means occupation i do not see that being peaceful and only restricted to the undocumented 

c im married to a naturalized citizen and they are easy to find because of the amount of information you must give uscis who was the very first group stephen miller made sure to focus on naturalized citizens 

for those of you that say this isnt america or they cant do that ill remind you that for  years black americans were second class citizens even though the constitution said they were not to really drive the point home i dont even need to go back to the jim crow era  i need only go to the s and what life was like in low income urban areas during the early days of the war on drugs during the crack cocaine era 

police were trained in paramilitary tactics used military grade weaponry and invaded neighborhoods nightly with no or sketchy warrants that ignored due process all they had to say is there is crack in that house all must be arrested or killed no questions asked while it has been greatly reduced the tactics are still used today and they are only eschewed when they get caught 

i wish i could end on something hopeful but my ptsd from growing up in se queens and atlanta during that era is firing at  degrees make preparations people remember the constitution derives its power from the people"
with trump admitting that hes going to declare a national emergency in order to utilize guard troops to deport immigrants what is stopping him from declaring dems and other political detractors as national security threats
as a german the term mass deportations always rings several alarm bells
"if he declares a national emergency it suspends laws he could seize private property suspend travel between states send in the military to states temporarily appoint officers in the military use private property for military purposes and a whole bunch of other fun things an autocrat would love 

congress can remove the order after a certain amount of time but it would have to be veto proof"
of course thats why his defense secretary has zero experiencehe wants someone wholl follow orders without question
this is how you first get american troops into american streets a faux national emergency the next time it will be easier and they will be used against citizens inflation is just the byproduct this is fascism for real we are there forget posse comitatus the constitution has been trashed he will stay in power until he dies and then he may have an appointed successor
"greetings from germany

first time"
well hitler gave himself emergency powers also so
"people also need to realize this isnt going to just hit illegals what they define as illegal will be down to when your local ice agent or deputized leo had lunch and how cranky theyre feeling

as a green card holder im living in fear that documented immigrants are going to get swept up in this and separated from families you dont cast a net this wide and recklessly without getting some fish you werent aiming for and i have zero faith in the trump administrations ability or even desire to undertake due process

so as a documented immigrant to this country im never going to forgive anybody that voted for trump and im never going to forget"
im watching the fall of my country in realtime its incredible that russia actually managed to win the cold war after all this time gg i guess
oh nothing bad can happen with this right right
what will trump bros do when strawberries are  a pound and they cant pick up day laborers in the home deport parking lot anymore
remember when he asked congress republicans to not pass the democrats border reform bill because he wanted to campaign on the issue
i hope all these apathetic people that cant find a job and blame women for being broke are ready to be forced into working the jobs that immigrants mostly worked those sitting at home mad that a woman is about to graduate college with a career lined up instead of brushing crumbs off your chest to sleep with you will not have a chance to work unpaid overtime at minimum wage in agriculture or construction unemployment will be below  with compelled labor
and his supporters are still doubling down on this xenophobic bullshit honestly if you openly support trump youre out of my life i dont care if youre family you could be my best friend if you openly support this man you are a fucking fascist and frankly i see you as a threat
"when he declares a national emergency that suspends laws

thats why thats the reason  suspend laws  you can get away with more crimes that way"
so can national emergencies be declared arbitrarily  like can biden declare a national emergency and cancel the transfer of power  how does this work
it really can happen here it seems
this article isnt addressing a huge piece of this  the country of origin must agree to take them back  they almost all refuse as a general rule  were going to have huge internment camps sucking up money that could be better spent elsewhere never mind the allusions of wwii germany and their camps
dont worry minority voters think trump is only talking about the other minorities
same thing hell do for any future elections just declare a national emergency and postpone the election until further notice
here come the leopards and boy are they hungry for face
covid  nah not a national emergency dont bother using that pandemic plan  illegal immigrants from decades of borderlaw mismanagement national emergency
"how many legal people you think will be caught up in this


with no trail or due process"
and when the countries he tries to deport people to turn them back hell put all of them in prison camps theres a reason private prison stocks rose up
"well be seeing a lot of things like this sorry mr president you cant do that unless its an emergency ok so declare it an emergency great now he can do that 

from the first day in office hell declare were a nation in crisis and everything from having his secretary bringing him burgers and coke to declaring martial law is going to be an emergency 

like any narcissist every text message from him is going to be labeled"
"if you think this will only affect immigrants think again hitler used the reichstag fire to declare an emergency in order to eliminate rights for everyone

the reichstag fire decree issued on february   in response to the reichstag fire suspended many civil liberties in germany this decree officially called the decree of the reich president for the protection of people and state was used by the nazis to suppress political opposition and consolidate power    
the decree suspended key civil liberties including   
 habeas corpus   
 freedom of expression   
 freedom of the press    
 the right to public assembly     
 the right of free association     
 secrecy of the post and telephone"
as is written in project  this then leads to martial law your fucked america
"jfc 

he convinced people that immigrants are the reasons for their problems instead of his own partys policies 

its amazing 

illegal immigrants arent taking your jobs they commit less violent crime than the average american populace and most illegal immigrants are due to visa overstays

so when they only go after brown people we will know that its all just ignorant racism mixed with absolute harmful stupidity 

it will make us look like the monsters we are"
declare a national emergency to consolidate his powerthat sounds familiar i faintly recall some austrian dude doing something similar in my country
"in the netherlands we also have a far right somewhat fascist government right now they tried to do exactly this use emergency legislature in order to stop asylum seekers from entering the country it didnt work because they were stopped by the court now they want to deport moroccans who have lived here for  generations claiming they are antisemitists 

this whole thing is a very scary worldwide trend i fear for the state of the world"
"when is kristallnacht going to happen  how will they determine if one is an illegal  will they only select black brown and asian people  will they go door to door and i will have to prove i am a citizen even though i was born here and my parents were born here

will the hit the brown cubans in miami who supported trump really doubt it"
"you want inflation  because this is how you get inflation

agriculture and meat packing and construction are huge employers of illegals because they work hard they work cheap and they dont dare complain

also theyre doing the work americans wont  i mean whens the last time you heard an american complain that an illegal took their job handpicking strawberries"
pay attention to pauls republic act which has been somehow making its way slowly through the senate it would put a limit on presidential ability to declare a national emergency without congressional approval initially it came about targetting biden but the gop in the senate might use it to reel in trumps mas deportation plan the gop wants power and wealth and they used immigration to get that and wont get rid of the cheap labor and doom the economy by solving immigration if so they lose any leverage to gain or maintain power in the future
for those of you who dont understand our whole economy is basically built on illegal labor so get ready for prices to go up and the market to crash
as hitler did with the jews someone needs to take the blame for all the problems in the country
"the stock market should take more of a tumble each time he opens his big dumb and nasty mouth signalling a state of emergency appears to be his attempt to soften up congress for his horror show cabinet picks do what i say or i will flex my emergency powers disobey me and i will step it up with martial law 

capital will flee from this madness before he is inaugurated"
under trump the usa will implode  unthinkable  years ago and now terrifying reality
yay military on my street ripping crying children from their homes all because you wanted to pay  less for eggs its unreal
i dont see how this wont blow up in their faces  people ignorantly think all these immigrants are harming the economy and the us  when businesses cant keep meat of the shelves and prices soar due to lack of labor people will be furious  fresh fruits and vegetables have the same issue  when housing prices soar due to lack of labor to build new the housing market will only worsen  basically name any industry where the us labor uses immigrants somewhere will quickly become issues  then you have the tariffs and terrible cabinet management  flooding the market with debt money like he did the first term isnt sustainable
"declaring a national emergency allows the army to operate within the borders   most countries worry about the army returning to their original mandate after the emergency is quelled  army in the streets special courtmartial groups remember these times 
welcome to trumps america"
"that is going be gloriously bad  declaring national emergency is to remove peoples rights like miranda and the need for search warrants

then you have  of the american population who doesnt trust the government and one of the highest density of guns on the planet  a military convoy rolling into a low economic area is going to create a hailstorm of bullets  but the illegal immigrants wont have guns  do you think that the criminals in that area will care if the military is trying to stop them or the immigrants no they will defend themselves innocents will be killed in the crossfire  there is a reason why the military try to avoid urban conflict"
"do you want concentration camps  
because thats how you get concentration camps"
people will get what they voted for
"id wonder how they plan to replace the farm workers theyll be deporting but rfk is already discussing work camps for people who are drug addicts or who are mentally ill because apparently forced labor and being confined to a camp is supposed to heal mental illness

cynically im wondering how long until they declare being queer or a liberal to be a form of mental illness"
dear usa trump is your national emergency govern yourselves accordingly
f for the service industry farms construction rich people gonna have to clean their own houses too and mow the lawn
"he doesnt mean that

it wont be that brutal

no camps and family deportations

all this is going to be the case and people fully know that and they still have voted for him"
lmao good luck fighting the lobbying by companies who rely on undocumented labor theyll deport like a small fraction of the undocumented population just to look like theyre doing something while the rest get extorted even more because said companies will use this deportation shindig as a massive stick to keep them in line
i keep hearing about this border crisis and this immigration emergency but in  years i still havent seen a single shred of evidence that any of this is a significant problem
"i remember this story

from high school history  years of studying nazi germany"
"we can just invent emergencies now 

also wouldnt the solution be aid and resources to the border states"
you know what its time for people to get hurt by this administration ive noticed people on the right only typically care about issues that directly effect them this is going to hurt people on both sides and maybe if they hurt their own people enough the next election will be different if we have another one im a middle aged white male thats lived here all my life im not going to be personally effected by this much i voted blue because many of my fellow americans will be hurt by this kind of thing i vote for the overall country not just what might benefit me
deporting millions of working people is gonna fuck with our economy in addition to tariffs
"they are going to send troops to metro areas  not the rural farming areas  this is the beginning of the kristallnacht they are going to try to take over the country  

slogan take back america
its not just the migrants they are going to round up"
i think you are supposed to use that to respond to a national emergency not create one
"i feel like the us is currently undergoing active measures from putin 
  
i watched the documentary with that name a while back about the history of russian psyops and quiet invasions its a decades long process of subtle destabilization and one of the objectives is to cause division trump and decades of fox news have succeeded in that 
  
trumps horrendous cabinet picks of severely unqualified loyalists must be pleasing daddy putin rn i feel like im going insane watching the unraveling of our institutions in real time im not usually one to be a sensationalist but things seem pretty fucked i hope blue states do their best to resist i dont want us to reach the normalization phase 
  
and just on this topic mass deportation will wreck our economy on top of making us look like monsters cant believe this shit"
the nazis are coming
theres about to be a bunch of fat lazy republican voters who are gonna be shocked when they have nobody to cook and clean for them and pick their food  poor little fatties are going to have to mow their own lawns  all these redneck patriot contractors wont have any staffing  haha  stupids
ya all wanted dictator on day  i didnt sign up for that shit hope you get what you want theres zero chance this fixes prices like eggs and gas but okay ya all wanna pay more
dont worry those egg prices will go down once all the farm labor is forced to work for free from prison before your tax dollars are used to purchase the pentobarbital that will eventually be used to execute the immigrants who resist or cant work
is anyone else feeling really furious about being forced to pay for the th reich with their taxes
"this was handled poorly during his first term and will be handled even worse now families will be forever changed and separated the economy will be heavily damaged and tax payer money will be wasted 

its going to be a mess and i dont believe they even have the manpower to handle it all theyll probably hire contractors who really dont care about what happens to the people who are just trying to make a living

republicans will find a way to blame biden and the dems so dont expect his followers to feel bad about their decisions because they are fed a constant stream of lies"
"watched homan on a hannity interview  hannity asked will you deport citizens    homan laughed and did not say no  he guffawed then said well start with the illegals and criminals then never said no to the original prompt  

my mom is a naturalized citizen since the s she has no connections back in her home country  if they try anything well im going to buy a gun today   now if the military comes then yeah probably pretty stupid to shoot  but if some trump gestapo or larping militia come around they can eat lead"
"besides this leading to concentration camp level of dictatorship according to the american immigration association this plan will likely cost a conservative estimate of  billion



in total we find that the cost of a onetime mass deportation operation aimed at both those populationsan estimated total of is at least  billion we wish to emphasize that this figure is a highly conservative estimate it does not take into account the longterm costs of a sustained mass deportation operation or the incalculable additional costs necessary to acquire the institutional capacity to remove over  million people in a short period of timeincalculable because there is simply no reality in which such a singular operation is possible for one thing there would be no way to accomplish this mission without mass detention as an interim step to put the scale of detaining over  million undocumented immigrants into context the entire us prison and jail population in  comprising every person held in local county state and federal prisons and jails was  million people

this plan is infeasible and will damage our economy more and will lead us further to a fascist country"
"im a latino who voted blue and was born here i guess i should start carrying my papers and proof of my parents papers lest i be questioned about being a birthright anchor baby and maybe im being paranoid but it seems like only a matter of time before thats declared invalid

incredibly angry at the self hating latinos who voted against themselvesincluding a cousin i dont speak to anymore"
i love it deport your workforce implement massive tariffs watch people long for the halcyon days of level inflation
a national emergency because some undocumented workers are doing housework farming gardening and construction

hes evil hes rotten to the core f u cheeto man
enjoy this country while you still can come january  the whole place goes to shit i fear never to return
so imagine  police brutality x

"a right voting friend of ours  his immigrant chinese wife just finalized her citizenship like two years ago and they have a daughter 

she may have the documents now but im actually still concerned since hes mentioned going after chinese harder first apparently he isnt worried though cause that wouldnt happen to him as an upstanding white american male"

i saw someone on x say can you believe the libs think were going through with project there are actual trump supporters who think project  was something they say just to troll the liberals not something that will actually happen
"first they came for the socialists and i did not speak outbecause i was not a socialist

then they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me
martin niemller"
not my problem till its my problem the american motto
"william roper so now you give the devil the benefit of law

sir thomas more yes what would you do cut a great road through the law to get after the devil

william roper yes id cut down every law in england to do that

sir thomas more oh and when the last law was down and the devil turned round on you where would you hide roper the laws all being flat this country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast mans laws not gods and if you cut them down and youre just the man to do it do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then yes id give the devil benefit of law for my own safetys sake

a man for all seasons

i think about this anytime maga talks about doing this kind of shit were about to enter peak leopards eating faces"
"no those other times that was okay because it didnt hurt me


first they came for the communists and i did not speak out because i was not a communist then they came for the socialists and i did not speak out because i was not a socialist 

then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew 

then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me pastor martin niemller"
the problem is anything negative in the next couple years will be biden fault anything positive will be trumps economy

nice i hope the ethics report still comes out leak it fuck the norms
he must really not want us to know whats in that house ethics report
he found out he would be working with jd vance not at a jv dance
nd report saying there was another sexual assault case with a minor every single republican who defended him are fucking sick weirdos
he just wanted that ethics report squashed
his nomination got too old
"he withdrew  minutes after cnn called him to let him know theyd be reporting on a second sexual encounter he had with an underage girl in 



edit not that this should matter but some people think this is another girl and have asked for clarification this is the same girl that he was accused of meeting with once before these news broke"
its a start but i fear whoever replaces him as the nominee will be terrible as well
"good he never should have been nominated in the first place 

he quit congress too so tf is he going to be now a fox news talking head"
now ghislaine maxwell can be nominated for ag
he didnt realize venmo could be traced
so now hell be charged and prosecuted using evidence from the ethics report as a private citizen right
pathetic to see the twitter cult defending a kid fucker
"while this is good news the next ag pick will be equally as bad in effect by originally nominating gaetz of all people to be the fucking ag of all things it shows trumps intentions and contempt for the department quash legitimate investigations launch investigations against political opponents and members of the press fire prosecutors let russian espionage agents run around freely within the us

the golden age of corruption begins on jan"
fine now pursue criminal charges for sex trafficking a minor
"he made a deal withdraw and the report is not released i guarantee thats what happened 

now just get someone to leak the damn thing"
mgts threatcall to expose everyone clearly worked
release the report
"good

release the ethics reports all of them stop sheltering sex offenders"
"i called this  days ago



he resigned immediately which avoided responsibility via the report due  trump did chocula a favor and nominated him to make an excuse  he then had a made up reason to resign

and now he withdrew

total bullshit

this is republican bs  a republican representative child predator got away with it  thanks to donald trump

this is the real disgusting criminal republican party on full display  

guy should get arrested and then we can see him walk free of the police and justice system too because republicans dont really care at all"
now he can get back to his true passion venmoing money to young women for absolutely no reason
the report just be so fucking bad that he is scared its going to leak and be in jail before he can get confirmed
"this was the plan all along wasnt it the report on him was set to be released in two days when he was nominated and resigned from the house this forced the report to be dropped before its release his appointment also drew attention away from other dangerous appointments like gabbard hegseth rfk jr

if theres one thing thats consistent about trump its long been his use of controversy to draw attention from controversy"
im worried that gaetz was used a scapegoat to anchor the ag pick so badly that whoever trump nominates next even though they will objectively be awful will still seem better than gaetz
"he had to drop out because the number of days since his nomination was quickly approaching 

 meidastouch"
release the report anyway cause fuck him
he is now a private citizen just go ahead with the prosecution he has no friends anymore in high places
how many scaramuccis is that
no fucking way
id celebrate there being one less pedophile in the government but the gop will just replace him with another pedophile
i guess also openly bragging about your sexual conquests to your colleagues complete with video evidence wasnt the power move you thought it was hey matt
"all part of a plan gaetz wont be prosecuted for being a fucking chomo trumpists told him to resign from congress so the ethics report couldnt be used as evidence

this is so typical for morally bankrupt and the corrupted trump cult"
this is great news but im scared to see whos next on deck part of me wants to think well trumps next pick cant be any worse than gaetz but we all know that yes yes it can be
and he quit congress hopefully this fuck fades into obscurity
only good thing to come out of this is hes no longer a member of congress
he clearly used all this to silence the ethics report
dems should be savages and still release the report
"lol


oh look the party of  if you have nothing to hide who cares

guilty fucker"
better carry that to term
how many scaramuccis did he last
man theyre really afraid of that report arent they
"in under  weeks not only do we already have a trump scandal its already over 

this is going to be a very very long  years"
his withdrawal shouldnt overshadow the fact that trump tried to nominate a pedophile for attorney general
one child predator down  to go
"so  now that we have an ethics report where hes clearly committed crimes

he should be charged with those crimes"
so we all think that its bad enough that he should go to jail right
kyle rittenhouse is gonna be watching his phone
not even inaugurated yet and theres the first domino to fall lets see if pete hegseth is next trumps second term is going to be a shitshow with huge turnover itll have
im sure trump has another child rapist in the wings ready to nominate
ill bet those on the ethics committee said they would release the report if he didnt step down  some republiklans were against gaetz being given that position since hes a child molester
not even a fraction of a scaramucci
were still two months away from his presidency and its already a shit show
"matt gaetz said thursday he is withdrawing as presidentelect donald trumps pick for us attorney general ending the controversial bid that put prior allegations of sexual misconduct in the spotlight

allegations of sexual misconduct is a huge understatement"
"lmao amazing  

to anyone who was too young during trumps first term to remember this is what it is like all the time he cant keep anyone he went through like  secretaries of state and chiefs of staff even more than that one guy lasted like  days  

the reasons for the rapid cycling are actually not uniform some people were idiot failsons and were never going to last anyway some are garden variety republicans who just got chewed up by trump world and on and on"
as always every republican accusation is a confession
is he withdrawing from the ag nomination or yet another minor
thats some very good news that being said whoever replaces him could be worse
him withdrawing is even more reason to let us know whats going on and mtg needs to be brought in for questioning regarding her statement
trump hires only the best people right
he should have said that to the teen girls he was sleeping with
"so happy to be wrong about this one i genuinely thought he would pass with furrowed brows and lectures about lessons from senators 


good riddance butthead"
now the challenge for the team is to see if we can nominate someone even worse
i wonder if the report would not only harm gaetz but bring other republicans into question during confirmation hearing madison cawthorns comments still ring out along side markwayne mullins
that ethics report and court hack mustve been really damning these are the types whove always pounded the table doubled down and never retreated
while it is ridiculous that his name was ever put forward to begin with and his withdrawal is clearly to get away from the ethics report him not being considered any more for ag is good news
release the report sunshine is important
wow trump is so weak he cant even get the ag he wants lol
"trump now has become so bad at keeping his staff that he loses them before officially hiring them

must be a speed run category"
do trump next
"i paid for that ethics report i want it released

also launch an investigation into why mean toe greene is protecting the child rapist by threatening other hidden rapists with blackmail"
fox news here he comes
im willing to bet that he was pressured to drop out by all the people that marjorie was threatening to expose and all the oligarchs along with it
"that report needs to be released regardless he has already resigned to keep the ethics investigation from moving forward to me this all screams that theres something that the public needs to know about and yes i realize that these are concerns that have been brought up for years now

im not saying they should but there are plenty of people with access to that information which could just be accidentally leaked just sayin"
"it seems like scott pinsker nailed it when he speculated that gaetz was trumps big bag of blood candidate

gaetzs nom was a big head fake to allow him to exit congress before the report was released repaying loyalty while triggering the left knowing they would raise hell then as planned gaetz withdraws and pam bondi is nominated  anyone following gaetz will seem relatively acceptable in comparison"
that ethics investigation must have been one hell of a report
the position must be too old for him now
withdrawing is not the same as pulling out
where are leaks when we need them
the norms have been ignored by republicans and treated as chains for the democrats
this whole bs about norms drives me nuts there have been numerous times over the years that ethics reports have been released after someone has left office even a few that have started after they left office this is just more gaslighting from the republicans on what they dont want to happen
all of them even the ones mtg is holding onto
amen brotha
well he can come back next congress because he was reelected so they could just release it jan  if they want
pretty upsetting to know that were being governed by a bunch of sex predators and cant really do anything about it
it should still come out
his buddy spilled the beans a while back and we have a pretty good idea about what he did transported at least one maybe two underage girls across state lines put them in a hotel room gave them illegal narcotics had solo and group sex with them made venmo payments with public comments
he found out he would working for jd vance not at a jv dance
no its the other republicans that dont want mtg to get the word out on them
hes no longer a sitting congressman the fbi will be way more likely to reopen the child sex trafficking case they bounced on the flimsiest of excuses
any member of the house who has possession of that report has a duty to read it into the record from the house floor
i dont understand whats the point to even having ethics report when there are things on the report that can end someones career and it still doesnt get released
too bad matt gates couldnt stand up to even a hunter biden level of scrutiny even more sad hunter biden wasnt even in office for anything and he experienced more scrutiny on his personal doings they always say if youve got nothing to hide then you have nothing to worry about but apparently matt gates wants to keep hiding everything hunter biden has more transparency in his affairs than any republican lately
in before this gets yoinked by one of the late night shows or snl weekend update
a joke
holy shit lmfao
the internet has its amazing moments
"funniest shit ive read all day  

if i had gold id give it to you"
lol i could see any of the late night guys saying this in the opening monologue
thats gold lmao

it would be interesting to see someone do a paper on the divorce rates that result from this election over the next four years i feel depending how incredibly worse things become those rate will spike especially if and when prices go up and public schools shut down
i guess this year at dinner ill get to say im thankful that my family is intelligent and empathetic enough to vote for anyone but trump
"my mom  dad both love trump my brother  i are the trump haters we finally decided to confront them this year and let them know how their unwavering support of a racist rapist for  years has made us feel they were very patient and listened to us intently they expressed regret for never considering our feelings before

just kidding they blew up at us and cancelled the holidays"
"sadly i was thinking of visiting my dad in texas this christmas but my brother has gone full maga since moving there in  

i thought hed be happy trump got elected instead i had  days of endless texts of hate until i finally blocked him"
"i saw a reel the other day that sort of articulated what many on the left are feeling when these people call for unity and keeping the peace what they actually mean is conformity and submission to their worldview in their opinion their side won so back into the kitchen and closets the rest of us go 

except it doesnt work like that unless we let them i wont sit down and keep polite what they want is inherently wrong immoral even"
i know i do not enjoy being in the company of people who hate me to the point that they will vote for a man who promises to use the united states military to deal with me
about to watch all those americans who said prices were high enough to warrant electing trump go spend all their money on bullshit for christmas
im staying at home with the dog on thanksgiving for the first time in  years instead of spending it with my moms family in the rgv gonna cook us some nice steaks for thanksgiving
"my grandpa has cancer again my family was planning on flying in from all over the country to see him but i dont think we will hes totally a maga hat while i love him a lot i am in the closet around him and none of his kids want to talk to him for more than a few minutes in person before trump he was a very interesting man with lots of lovely knowledge now all he talks about is such awful things

concerning the article i do hope she divorces him i understand that reddit is all about divorce but i feel like this is just such a sad way to live hell never understand why people hated that he voted for trump  and i dont think living your one life with a person who clashes so much with your ideas is a good way to go through things"
"i think its reasonable id stick with a simple quiet explanation if she calls you dramatic just go with a very level im sorry i cant see you the same way any more

fwiw i also think your relatives are showing their hands if they genuinely thought the economy was in such a critical place and trump was so instrumental to turning it around that they had to face the grim reality of sacrificing the rights and safety of fellow citizens as the lesser of two very bad options they would not be laughing and mocking the people who will suffer they wanted that outcome"
"wednesday morning of last week my wife said that she doesnt know if shell ever want to see my family again because voting for trump is a direct attack on her freedoms i totally get this sentiment even if people think its hyperbolic 

i saw so many people who i assumed were trump supporters or openly trump supporters posting shit like we can still be friends despite our political differences   no saying women should die because you made abortion illegal isnt a political difference how do they not get this"
"trumps policies are so polarizing his behavior is so disgusting that we all know it ended relationships and marriages during his first presidency and most likely it will happen again 

the problem isnt just that one spouse or one partner votes for one party and the other votes for another fundamentally the policies the attitudes the stance on climate change human rights criminal accountability womens autonomy are so diametrically opposed it is hard to find any common ground if any  

its not just opposing views it is the silo of views the media machines have churned out polar opposite views on everything making it next to impossible to have a healthy conversation 

theres also the reality on the ground that in  women are dying because theyre being denied emergency care for reproductive health one side does not see a problem with that and one side does these are very serious issues that are hard to get past"
"yup  cant imagine celebrating while being among people who proudly voted for a felon rapist and traitor

edit  though this year i am probably done with being polite  they seem to like it when people tell it like it is so if you tell me you voted for trump im happy to tell you that youre a fucking idiot  hey nice nativity scene  you realize you voted for the guy who would have deported joseph and mary right"
arent they going after no fault divorce as well i would get that underway before the admin gets in you can always live with him afterwards but at least you have freedom to leave
"my extremely maga family who lives in rural bucks county asked me what dates id be home for christmas this year i told them i wasnt coming the last time i went back there i got harassed by strangers for having massachusetts plates the ignorant bunch just associate me with liberal politics and not as a human being i can only imagine its going to be far worse this time around and quite frankly id rather be alone than around a dinner table where everyone is praising a psychopath who brainwashed enough americans into becoming president 

not to mention they voted against my rights as a gay person im extremely concerned about the rhetoric and enablement that homophobes and other bigoted minds are going to get out of this administration i dont really feel safe anymore"
"if my spouse had voted for trump i would be questioning her core beliefs  

this isnt about politics its about character  

if she could have voted for a person with the character of donald trump that would make me question her character"
if politics were only about where to budget tax money and deficits and stuff there wouldnt be any issue coexisting at thanksgiving but we are talking human rights and the future of democracy here
i unironically had a friendsgiving cancelled because the host didnt think people would be able to get along and be around each other because a couple in the group voted for trump
"im starting to distance myself from talking any politics at all i know i cant change their minds on anything and honestly im worried that things i say now will be used against me in the future

welcome to america"
it hurts my feelings more than i can say that my parents voted for things that will hurt my children they are very elderly and frail and need their childrens help and we dont feel like giving it its so very sad
how many of you purged friends and family after the election results i know i did
"republicans dont understand humanity 

you didnt win cultural dominance you didnt win freedom from consequences you didnt even win authoritarianism you won a happy feefee on election night 

your family will not suddenly transform into a fictional s tv show you wont suddenly be promoted to the csuite at work your win was shallow and shortterm now you reap the consequences"
same wife is furious she will lose her student loan public service forgiveness if the dept of education gets guttedand im about to lose my health insurance if the ada gets gutted its infuriating that we are about to get booted out of the middle class and she doesnt want to spend time with people that celebrate that and since every single member of her family minus her mom are truck nut maga hat loud supporters they can go enjoy things with each other
speaking of thanksgiving ive worked at a tyson plant before tyson turkeys its pretty ironic as to whom works those plants immigrants full of them
family thinks im a traitor they could be a danger to me all of them cult members no more contact
i already did this following the  election my mental health has thanked me for it no more annoying conversations that get spun into a political gaslighting argument
to anyone reading this who does not support trump and resonates with this article dont let the people posting here make you feel like youre the bad person you have a right to feel the way you do theres a lot of gaslighting magaspod people in this thread stick to your convictions and know there are many out there feeling outrage and utter disappointment in their friends and family who voted for him
honestly i knew i was already very privileged to have a family without divorced parents but now i realize i have a unicorn family  we like each other want to spend time with each other and not one treasonous dumb fuck in the bunch
"im thankful that i already cut out all my toxic family members im doing thanksgiving and christmas but its just me my husband and son im actually looking forward to it

my husband didnt vote for trump i dont think i could stay married to him if he did"
"this is like leaving an abusive relationship on a national level  he said hes changed he doesnt really mean the things that come out of his mouth etc 

were going right back into the abusive relationship sigh"
friendsgiving is about to be huge in the next few years
"im torn between dont talk politics with your family and if you wondered what normal people did when the nazis rose to power look at yourself and those around you

my family knows where i stand  one of them hates going to my house because they have to walk by a pride flag to get in  he tried to make fun of me calling me gay im straight  i told him i frankly dont care what he may think my sexuality is

we live in a country where people love their skygods based on faith but hate the people that clearly exist right here in front of them  then theres a group of people that simply couldnt be bothered to show up and vote because of apathy  shame on both of those groups

ive got a feeling i wont recognize this country four years from now"
im going to keep saying it we can have different opinions on politics its the fact that we now live in a world where sexual assault felonies blatant racism blatant homophobia are all non deal breakers for so many americans these are moral values not political views all sexual assault victims and survivors now have to live with the fact that their predators can become the president
"this was inevitable 

for the past decade maga have destroyed every norm and convention in us society but enjoyed the positives because everyone else just accepted it the perfect example is trump lose  rigged election but trump win  fair election they wanted to have their cake and eat it too 

now everyone else have finally dropped the decorum and are prioritising their own peace its finally affecting the day to day life of maga and they dont like it"
idk if this is the place to put it but for anyone who doesnt feel safe or welcome over the holidays were putting together an online thanksgiving on discord for anyone interested
"i know he is a good man and he would do anything for a family member or friend

literally voted to take your cousins rights away btw so maybe not anything eh"
trump is just the end game for a process that has been going on for almost  years a process that has been repeated time and time again for  years of history once the ultra rich band together to grab power through racism and xenophobia its almost never been stopped
i would probably break up with my partner if she voted for trump it would be difficult to stay with someone when you lose all respect for that person who voted to fuck over both our lives
ive canceled every single one of my trump relatives  we usually have a whole family thanksgiving gathering but we are done with that for the rest of our lives
every single person that voted for that man is an enemy of democracy i would rather spend the holiday alone than pretend their insanity is excusable
good cut the fascists out of everything like a cancer
well trump voters have made it clear that they hate us for the past  years why should we entertain them when we could be doing something healthy
"my brother concern trolled me about trump when he visited my home a few months ago hes a doctor and thats important because my wife is immune compromised she requires monthly infusions of antibodies to not suffer life threatening infections i made it clear to my brother than trumps admin would cut my health insurance i mentioned it was even likely id have to move overseas just to afford healthcare 

my doctor brother laughed 

he sent me a maga wednesday i told him that i was done with him trolling me while stabbing me in the back and finding it funny is a bridge too far

you cant choose relatives i can choose those i have around me my brother whined to my dad who pressured me to relent but f that he made a choice he can live with it

same goes for my friends"
ive heard people respond to reactions like this like how could you cut off family because of who they voted for and really it comes down to its not because of who they voted for its what they voted for
divorce him while you still can
we disinvited my sister in laws family that were gleeful cheering in group about mass deportations  they are both coptic arabs both first generation  one with shakey legal status
more power to her i could never stay married to a trumper
looks like magas gonna have to visit each other for the holidays too bad they all cant stand one another
a latino voted for trump  wow  what a surprise that is   macho males  latino on latino hate    i dont know a lot about the culture  i do get that there is a whole male macho im not gay libs are gay mindset from black brown and white males    im male and dont want to have anything to do with those males   i would say i dont want to have anything to do with those men but i refuse to call them men
this is why i believe we must continually and consciously maintain our inner circles blood is meaningless if one fundamentally opposes some family members humanity
incredible how this one man has done more damage and division in this country than any war couldve
"to the folks criticizing op for breaking up with family over politics or difference of opinion you are really missing the mark here this is a difference of morality and values and when people have wildly opposing moral viewpoints and values it makes perfect sense that they wouldnt hang out  

trumpers should not be shocked at this reaction what in the world did they expect"
maybe divorce the husband as well while no fault divorces still exist
your husband and family were swindled but they have the next  years to learn they fucked up bad
her having to figure out how to say something so as to not trigger his ego and subsequent shut down damn men be oppressing womens feelings by harnessing fragile masculinity
"years ago way back in  i could tell they were going to villianize liberals it has been the cornerstone of their rhetoric for  years

i guess i had faith that smarter people were in the room"
"its sad that she has no idea that her marriage is over  
you can love someone and have been through too much  
but the flagrant display of all that will eat her soul  
the next article will be about her midlife divorce from her selfcentered but performative husband and how much it hurts that she never knew him at all"
my f wifes f all votes for trump they are educated people they have great careers the only reason they can give is gaza and economy and literally nothing has made them question him my sil openly admits she hates trump but gaza and economy im so fucking enraged they keep insisting all the generic lies like hes not going to really do x y z thank god we dont have to do thanksgiving or anything with them this year
"i would cancel the marriage tbh wouldnt even need time to think about it 

i dont want this maga bs in my life"
"still i know he is a good man and he would do anything for a family member or friend

well not anything"
we all need to do this i have already arranged for thanksgiving and christmas with real americans traitors can feed themselves together while they celebrate violence against their neighbors make jokes about who theyre going to keep as slaves
my whole immediate family voted for trump and the crazy thing is were hispanics i dont feel like i have a family anymore and dont even wanna see them anymore
"yep half my familys pissed because were not sitting at the table with nazis

one day when people ask how the us could go from obama to hitler so fast its because we let it into our homes piece by piece let the nazis sit there at holidaysyoure family youre more important than politics  the nazis never felt that way though"
"my bfs family not him thinks im rejecting god and denying him like judas because i dont agree that trump winning is good apparently trump winning was gods protection prob skipping out christmas 

oh and were canadian not even american"
id divorce my wife if she voted for trump you cant be an intelligent caring person if you voted for this dude theres something missing empathy intelligence common sense take your pick
great decision these people need shunning
i wouldnt care as much if they werent the ones bring up politics constantly and looking for arguments all the time i dont know any trump supporters who can control themselves when it comes to biting their tongue and keeping the peace
trump voters being upset that their actions have consequences is so funny to me but thats how we should be reaponding if they wont feel any political consequences make them feel personal ones
good for you
idk why she should have to host them its weird being near people who are fine with you dying in a manner we know how to prevent but decide they should die anyway
im avoiding family gatherings this year just not up to it still disgusts me that my family members supported that rotten orange
my asshole family loves trump too which is why we havent had thanksgiving or christmas in almost a decade join the club
"my parents complained about this country for  years theyre too concerned about their image to admit they voted for trump but said the democrats have turned this country into a socialist pit said trump will fix everything but still wont admit they voted for trump i have never asked them either fwiw bc there is no need to

 days ago i was facetiming them w my daughter i mentioned the election and just how im concerned about the aca for them with medicare and their social security i admittedly said unfortunately everyone is going to get what they voted for they essentially ignored everything i said except for that step mom got upset and when i asked what the problem was she started screaming so i hung up

now they have blamed me for ruining christmas blamed my generation for everything thats wrong with this country demand an apology for making them feel uncomfortable in my house even tho i told them i would not like to let the let politics get between us for the sake of our mo daughter then they doubled down on blaming everything on me im in an interracial marriage and they claimed that bring up the election was wrong out of respect for my wife and inlaws im curious where that respect was when they voted but we know the answer to that they cannot believe how bad of a person i am for making them feel the way they do also claim that the issue with this country is my generation is allowed to talk but doesnt want to let anyone else speak so i can listen to them complain for  years but as soon as i bring up concerns with new policies its how dare you bring up politics we were never going to bring this up then claimed i came to them with an agenda

they literally will not speak to me until i apologize to them for them feeling uncomfortable about their decision to vote for trump its literally my fault they are uncomfortable about voting for trump make this make sense"
"i canceled a cruise paid for by my trump dad who i havent talked to in  years hed be there too with his holier than thou wife up until a week ago i was going with my husband but now i want nothing to do with him and her 

my dad and the rest of the trumpy family had previously turned their back on me and his own brother because were liberal i despise them all he wanted to see me one last time on this cruise no thank you bye i was just using him to go on a nice cruise our first but there would be too much drama

only my mom and my husbands mom are reasonable my husbands family also drank the kool aid so he cut them all out

well go on our own trip with no strings attached"
"my parents tv has the fox logo literally burned into the corner of their tv screen while my daughter watched pbs and cocomelon the fox logo was omnipresent this is what it did to their brains i lost them to trump in  and it has never been the same 

i miss them"
im kinda like fk all these trump supporting family members i already know all the stuff they say behindcloseddoors
"so the writer is a liberal and her husband is a maga

girl you let that leopard eat your face"
heck yeah do not cook clean and entertain for a bunch of people who want you to be property and a third class citizen also get a divorce now before its too late
"i understand this may be hard for many of you but would you willingly bend your morals to break bread with people who hate you your friends your significant other who conspire behind your back demonize those who matter to you

they hurt not only you but your children and your childrens children their hateful rhetoric and antiscience agenda has stolen from your future and that of your children all that you hold dear and care for they poison

do not let them lie and manipulate you into thinking their views are just politics  they have already shifted the narrative enough to where people believe hating gay people denying scientific research and data or removing womens rights are valid politician opinions  they are not those are signs of a persons character and morals the ship for we just have a difference of political opinion has sailed long ago and it was their own doing

if they want to be bitter hateful lunatics let them find out how loneliness is the price to pay for such behavior"
and i keep hearing how its a matter of opinion  no  an opinion is do you prefer soda or juice  this is a matter of amorality
anecdotal but there are a lot of divorce lawyers whove said theyve received at least twice as many calls as normal in the week following the election im curious to see what the numbers are in a few years too
pretty sure they will take away a womans right to initiate a divorce soon
on a previous post someone told of their father who had a black wife and lived in a blue city who lied and told his wife he was voting for harris when he actually voted trump i assume that could lead to a divorce if she found out
well people have about  months to get that ball rolling because project  is going to do a way with nofault divorce trump is admitting its his platform now so i really hope the women who need to gtfo get going now
i broke off a relationship in  when he first got elected id imagine this year is worse because people know who they voted for this time around
"but didnt the evangelicals say that behavior will be more righteous under trump

wait now i see what they meant by nofault divorce

if god wanted people to be more righteous hed tell us how to be directly wordforword too bad he already tried that and a majority of evangelical dipshits would still cancel jesus if he returned today its why i dont take the whole its gods will lecture so seriously

like if itll be gods will when sinful and blasphemous communities to be destroyed why are all the hurricanes and floods passing up california or new york its almost as if theyre missing the parts of the us that spreads hatred blasphemy greed hol up i think i understand gods will now"
"ive been saying it for years trump is a permission slip for people to be their worst selves openly

sadly i think the answer is that the country as a whole is much more misogynist and racist than i thought it could be"
"yeah must be nice mine is   fox trumpers they always ask why i dont come around much anymore like ok even if you support the agenda it doesnt have to be  of the topic of conversation

its idolatry through and through"
"i am a yearold white guy and i am incredibly lucky that both of my parents are still alive and not nazis


unfortunately every single one of my other biological relatives through their support behind this evil man so they are more than dead to me"
you had me there lol
i cant have a social visit with my parents without it escalating to yelling because they want to spout off on whatever was on the fox news chyron that day  im the only child  they were nothing but doting parents for my entire childhood and since about  theyve become miserable unbearable people to be around
the jealousy i felt reading your comment really hit me until i got to the end i feel you
i hope you instead get to spend it with friends and loving people in your life the chosen family is much better than the blood one tbh
not gonna lie you had me in the first half
cult
had me in the first
"sounds like the budget for your and your bros xmas gift to each other just tripled nice  idkay but my brother gives me way better gifts than my parents ever did 

this is  a  joke silver lining comment im sorry your parents are assholes my elderly mom is dating a magat from her church even though shes extremely liberal i tried talking to her about and she said i dont care i love him thank the gods we dont live in the state and i wont have to deal with him over the holidays meanwhile i pulled the trigger on getting a tubal ligation which will happen as early as thanksgiving week"

now that a majority expect higher prices the tariffs dont even need to happen for companies to raise prices
google trends still shows people are asking who pays for tariffs weeks after the election
and rd of americans are complete morons
"twothirds of americans think donald trumps tariff plans will only add to rising costs if implemented and many are planning purchases ahead of his inauguration anticipating higher prices according to a harris poll conducted exclusively for the guardian

trump has called tariffs the most beautiful word in the dictionary yet about  of americans think tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices according to the poll

the majority of democrats  independents  and republicans  all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the us nearly the same percentage of respondents said that tariffs will have a significant effect on what they can afford

read the full story"
one third of americans are unfathomably stupid
yet according to that same poll  percent of americans agree with trumps tariff plans this is the american electorate in a nutshell
i thought my i told you sos would start in january but im already almost out and its not even thanksgiving yet  i will have to do an emergency reorder   hope those are not subject to tariffs too
i guess a third of americans still dont understand how tariffs work
this is what happens when people vote for the candidate that hates the same people they hate
elections have consequences  barack obama
"quoting  economists largely disagree with trumps argument that tariffs will mean a significant uptick in domestic manufacturing companies will likely simply pass increased costs onto customers

well duh  its always the lowest on the ladder that pays the price"
the other third are in for a surprise
"we voted for a guy that doesnt find the best solution he picks one often suggested to him from somewhere else and quadruples down on it regardless of how bad everything goes up in flames  buckle up and save up

its trumps razor impossible to distinguish ineptitude from willful destruction of america"
"know twothirds of americans know it will thats how tariffs work

onethird of americans get pissed on by republicans and tell the rest of us its raining"
the remaining third responded what to the question
so it wasnt the price of eggs gee wonder what the real reasons were hatred of people who dont look like them or act like them or think like them hatred of women because it apparently wasnt the price of eggs who could possibly have guessed
"and its not just the cost of imported products that are going to rise 


tariffs will impact prices across the board including those of domestic products very few items produced in america are made entirely independent of the global supply chain from the raw materials to the machinery used in production this means that the cost to produce domestic goods are likely to rise leading to higher prices for consumers"
you voted for this
instead of making trump i did that stickers they should be sticker mirrors that say i voted for this
then why did you cucks vote for him dear god i feel like im taking crazy pills
slapping a general tariff on all imports is going to raise prices from items in groceries to car parts its impossible to escape
of course it will the american people voted there was a primary process and they voted to allow a convicted felon the most corrupt political figure in american history to sit at the height of power and influence in the us and become president again character no longer matters honesty no longer matters rules of decorum no longer matter his policies of vengeance policies to protect and grow wealth for the wealthy policies that will increase fear among marginalized communities  empowering of hate and retribution  the american people voted this is what we wanted i want to be hopeful lets pray for positive outcomes i would love to be wrong
republicans  all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the us so even republicans believe in that
but trump was stronger on the economie
this must mean a portion of the  voted for him and many cited the economy as a reason for voting for the criminal so wtf gives
"one candidate said theyd take on price gauging another candidate said theyd raise prices  

the people said things have been expensive these past  years so were going to vote to make them even more expensive because of how expensive its been

maga math"
i just want to say that its insane how much relatively reasonable back and forth conversation is going on in conservative subs about tariffs now when there was hardly anything of the sort before the election its almost like theyre part of a cult and someone has just handed them the kool aid
welp time to buy up some trump i did that stickets to paste well everwhere i guess
"people who vote republican are dolts who believe anything

tariffs have been around for hundreds of years they are a protectionist tool they are used to protect important national products or industries from unfair foreign competition they work by placing an artificial monetary penalty to the cost of a foreign  product and that is designed to cause consumers to choose to buy a samesimilar domestic product because the price of the foreign product they might choose is now too high

and republicans the progenitors of the free trade have followers that are too stupid to read or understand the basics of how things work in the real world because they have been groomed to believe lies and magical thinking talking points"
"thats weird i saw a sign on the road today in rural nc that said trump low prices kamala high prices

was this sign lying

s"
i wish twothirds of americans had fucking voted that way they just let fascists take over theyre just letting them do it i cant fucking believe this entire god forsaken country
i fully expect eggs prices to come down if they dont im going to be annoying maga  why the prices are still high even if its  years later
i encourage everyone to get ahead of this now in terms of the likely outcome of these tariffs because fox and other legacy media will attempt to gaslight the public months from now when the economy goes to shit as a result of trumps dog shit agenda they will blame it on biden the democrats millenials liberals lgbtq whatever theyre going to run damage control for trump and the gops incompetence by trying to gaslight the public into thinking the reason is anything but trump and the gop we need to combat the media and do so preemptively its a bandaid on a gunshot wound but its better than nothing and perhaps we can reach some people by educating them and letting them know what the reason will be when they go to walmart or lowes and the cost of goods is inflated mark my words fox will do everything they can to convince republican voters that this isnt trumps fault we cant let them do that we need to fight back and do it now plant the seeds
this is how much theyve been taught to hate democrats
heres the thing  the ones who know and still voted for trump do not care the ones ive spoken to are fully convinced that whatever elon said about times getting hard is a prophecy and needed they know and still seem to think its a good thingand these are very lowermiddle class people same thing with health insurance
wont matter theyll blame it on the libs and the lemmings will believe them
america voted for this so america can live with the results and consequences  this is what an uninformed electorate can do to a country
hope all of the midwest is ready for our gas prices to go up we import most of our crude oil from canada so gas will go up by  if trump gets his way
suddenly bidens horrible economy doesnt look so bad
last week walmart came right out and said they would be raising prices due to the tariffs were  of america just not paying attention
of american adults read below a sixth grade level
"the other  voted for him

if only the  of americans who are nonvoters actually showed up"
"correction twothirds of americans know trumps tariffs will lead to higher prices poll says 

if conservative voters took the time to learn literally anything they didnt have to learn in school or for their jobs theyd know all this already too"
maybe hear me out but mayyyybe the voters knew higher prices were part of the deal and were willing to pay it for the hate and anger he promised hed bring to those others
"because they will holy fuck are americans who voted for trump fucking stupid

trump doesnt even know how a tariff works or if he does he knows it will only increase prices i am so glad i am planning to leave this dogshit country"
"so if tariffs will raise domestic pricing why is trump proceeding with this i would imagine he has some economist with him saying this is a bad idea right

no one in his circle thinks its a bad move"
"alternate headline 

twothirds of americans actually know what tariffs do unlike the president elect"
twothirds of americans know trumps tariffs will lead to higher prices    because we know how tariffs work
they will   and the other  are uneducated idiots   its also going to lead to shortages of things   dont worry though  the rich will still be fine
"and yet a bunch of them voted for him to lower the price of groceries 

dumbasses"
the other  have been wearing their red hats so tight its cut off circulation to their thinkers
if youre someone who voted for trump honestly fuck you this collective nightmare that we are all going to experience is your fucking fault and i cant stand you
"remember when all those voters jumped to trump election and said it was primarily the economy lol 

not the sharpest"
thats what you get for voting for him stupid idiots brain dead people
and yet they still voted for him idiots
yeah but they get to own the libs or something idk
"well maybe they shouldnt have fucking voted for him then 

seriously i am so beyond giving a fuck about this shit massive tariffs on all imports has legitimately been the second most important plank in the dudes platform since he started campaigning in earnest again right behind forcibly deporting tens of millions of people 

dont vote for the guy thats going to intentionally raise prices if you care about prices if you do then you deserve whatever you get imo"
so why did you fucking vote for him then this wasnt new news he was preaching tariffs on the election trail
most us manufacturing companies that outsource partscomponentsmaterials do so on contract terms  for a tariff to drive the work back to the us it would need to outlast the contracts  its a better and cheaper bet to wait  years and assume the next admin will drop the tariff while just passing on cost to consumer until then  once the tariff drops off consumers will be used to the price so companies will keep the price and reap profits from the tariff removal  moving more money to the top while convincing idiots hes doing it for them  people need to stop talking about trump like hes an idiot he is in a lot of ways but when its the personal gain and wealth accumulation for him and his  hes smart and pulling this one over on just enough people to make it happen  worlds greatest grifter and people fall for it
the  have always been the problem
well yeah because thats how itll work
because theyre right
then those  of americans should have voted against him
anger over postpandemic high prices has led to incumbent governments everywhere being removed from power yet a decisive majority of americans seem to understand that we have voted for policies that would further increase prices  make it make sense
oh no how can this be  trump is doing exactly what he said he was going to do oh my and the consumer is going to pay more for fruits and vegetables but what about the cost of eggs  well at least we owned the libs and we are going to show those trans people they have no bathroom rights  s
why invest in making americanmade goods cheaper when you can just make everyone elses goods more expensive its not like the us government has any interest in investing in their own industries the way other countries do that would be an example of leadership but theyd call it communism
are the losers who voted for trump
and their dumbasses voted for him anyway
and its cool because the libs were owned
so do  of economic experts unfortunately our nation decided to vote for a guy who says experts are always wrong and hes always right
where were these  this past election
and yet they voted for him  jfc
"theres going to be an inflection point at about  years in between when the economic gains of biden administration subside and the shit policies and market volatility of a trump administration takes its toll

we saw something similar with trumps first term after obama set the economy up for success"
they literally voted for this
"fucking duh you complete and utter idiots 


hes not a black chick though so its cool"
so they voted him in part due to inflation under biden whilst also acknowledging that trumps policies will increase inflation morons
are correct the other  are idiots information at their fingertips and they dont understand what a tariff is
if only there was some way of knowing about this before voting for him
many of these dipshits voted for it
and yet the stupid elected him
"only rds

i mean on its face if you throw  tariffs on really anything theres going to be a price impact idk why you would think otherwise"
"think

nah we know"
cant believe only  are stupid enough not to realize it
hes such an idiot  china will step in for canada and mexico instantly  hes basically giving the world economy to china  what a moron  think unemployment was high during his first presidency wait till the end of this one
many of these people will also say we think he is a nasty and pitty person we dont agree with many remarks of his but we will vote for him why oh the egg price is so high and i dont like woke talk on the media plus trump is so so good at economy
"so about  know tariffs will increase prices

yet about  or so voted for it 

make it make sense"
im guessing the third that dont think so are the ones who voted for that idiot
id like to take this opportunity to extend a warm fuck you to the  of americas who decided not to vote in this last election thanks much assholes
but  eligible voters voted for him something is not adding up
does anyone here think republicans will own the trumptariffs  once they do the damage theyll find someone else to blame when prices skyrocket
"this is one of the many reasons i was so disappointed by the american election  while i was sad for americans i knew it would have a large impact on canadians

your president elect is going to drag multiple other countries into a recession with you and youre gonna have a chunk of your population thank him for it while blaming everyone else"
its time print a bunch of i did that stickers with trump on them to stick everywhere
he took a machete to the economy in his first term now hes gonna drop an  gigaton thermonuclear warhead on it
"its hilarious watching the conservative sub get angry about this

they know whats going to happen they dont like it but theyll still defend him"
and yet  of americans voted for him
"and apparently a lot of those people did not vote

fuck them"
and the morons still voted for him
well where the fuck were they on november rd
"twothirds of americans are more financially literate than i gave them credit for

too bad it wasnt enough to prevent trump from retaking the white house"
