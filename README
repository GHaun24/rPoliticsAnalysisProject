# Reddit Political Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes sentiment from comments collected across multiple subreddits about political topics.
The program identifies and categorizes comments based on sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative)
and political affiliation (Democrat, Republican, or Neutral).

### Features

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleans comments by removing URLs, special characters, and converting text to lowercase.
   - Drops invalid or empty comments to ensure data quality.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Uses the VADER sentiment analysis tool to classify comments as `Positive`, `Neutral`, or `Negative`.

     - **Pie Charts**: Sentiment breakdown for Democrats and Republicans.
     - **Bar Charts**: Most common words used for Democrats and Republicans.
